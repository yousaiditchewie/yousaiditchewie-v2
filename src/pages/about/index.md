![Portrait of Jacob Allen](/img/portrait.jpeg)

I successfully transitioned from being a touring and session drummer to being a tenured software engineer. I currently work for Ramsey Solutions, a [Dave Ramsey](https://www.daveramsey.com) company, where I build marketing sites and develop web applications. 

Through my career as a developer, I’ve learned some of the Internet’s best practices for growing an online audience and turning followers into paying customers and life-long fans.

My mission is to share my knowledge in a way that sets musicians up for success.

The music industry has changed for the better. It makes it so that musicians don’t have to wait to get picked by a record label or get picked by a band or get picked by a radio station to have a successful career. 

>The Internet is your venue, and millions of people show up everyday.

I release new content every week that offers tools for building your audience, turning your creativity into income, and restoring dignity to Music as a career choice.
