  Being a musician can often mean that income is unpredictable, and career
  growth is unclear. Here’s how I transitioned from being a full-time musician
  to being a full-time software engineer, and why I think you should learn to
  write code.

It’s no secret that I’m passionate about musicians learning to code. In fact, I’m so passionate about it that I wanted to remove any barriers keeping musicians from doing so. That’s why I’m now offering [coding tutorials for musicians](/#products) — well, for everyone, but especially musicians.

Here are the myths I’m debunking:

### Myth 1: Coding is only for smart people
>Learn to code, and you too can be smart.

### Myth 2: Learning to code is expensive
> My tutorials are $10, $5, and FREE. You can afford them.

### Myth 3: It takes time to learn
>That’s actually not a myth, but what else are you doing?

You can read all about [why I’m teaching musicians how to code](/blog/why-im-teaching-musicians-how-to-code) if you’d like, but you’re probably here to learn *why I learned to code*...

## Why I learned to code

If you've ready [my story](/blog/short-story-long), you know that I’m passionate about music, and was able to make a decent living for myself as a full-time musician. But work started to dry up at the same time that my responsibilities started to ramp up (getting married and wanting to start a family), and I needed to make a tough decision to put music on the back burner and focus on providing for my family. 

> Easier said than done.

I had a background in providing tech support at Apple, and ironically found an amazing IT job at NASA (yeah, spaceships and satellites NASA). 

While working at NASA, I was able to see some really smart people do some incredible things with code. I remember one time, I got a support ticket to help someone, and when I asked what kind of work he was doing, he told me he was programming the Mars rover for the next 12 hours.  

> With code written on planet Earth.

Ok, so how did I get into writing code? I quit my NASA job, and went to a coding bootcamp. I had a great experience at bootcamp, but in hindsight, I would have kept that NASA job and learned to code online. But the bottom line is, you can learn to code without quitting your job. 

> Transitioning careers shouldn’t be risky.

## Why you should learn to code

Most musicians are struggling right now amid the COVID-19 shutdown. If you’re struggling right now, check out my article on [how musicians can make money while quarantined](/blog/how-musicians-can-make-money-while-quarantined/). 

### Financial stability

Learning to code has given me and my family stability that would not have existed right now had I not learned to code. I’m very blessed that me and my family have felt only minor affects of the Coronavirus economic crisis. Not to mention, software engineers are among the highest paid employees in most companies (of course there are exceptions). 

I’m not trying to toot my own horn, but **I’m making more money as a software engineer than I was as a musician**, and I actually made really good money as a musician.

### Flexible hours

If you go the freelance route with your coding career, you make your own hours and deadlines. This means you can build websites, make apps, or start an internet business, all while still being a musician.

> AKA **double income**.

And best of all, you can do it from **anywhere** — even a tour bus.

### Career growth

One of the things that drove me crazy about being a musician was how unclear it was what to charge people for my time and how to set my rates. Sometimes I could quote my price and a production could take it or leave it, but most of the time, people would tell me what the budget is for hiring musicians, and I could take it or leave it. There was no clarity on how to increase my income to match my skills. 

Yeah, part of this was the fact that I needed to learn negotiation skills and other business and marketing skills, but it makes it really difficult when no one is sharing their numbers.  

I can go on [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) right now and find several companies hiring software engineers in my area, and find salaries associated with those jobs. They may not be exact, but they will be close. But there’s no way to find out financial numbers for musicians. Most people are guessing, and some people get it right, but they don’t share their secrets. 

But learn a technical skill like writing code, and there are dozens of resources on career growth. It’s a lot more obvious what skills you need to learn to advance to the next pay scale, and typically, software engineers love helping people level up.
