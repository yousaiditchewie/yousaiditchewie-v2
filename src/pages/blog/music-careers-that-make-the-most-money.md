When it comes to building a career as a musician, we all want the Instagram-able lifestyle we see on other musicians’ feeds — the selfie with ?uestlove after playing on Fallon, the view from the stage at Red Rocks Amphitheater, the red carpet for a movie premier that featured your song. The other side of that coin, however, is the hustle, failure, stress, and anxiety that lead up to those moments.

> No one talks about that.

And aside from the amazing experiences we see on social media, how are you doing financially?

> No one talks about that either.

And then there’s the confusion over how exactly to create the career you see other people enjoying. How did they get where they are now?

Some people talk about that, but everyone’s story seems to be different, and everyone seems to have different advice on how to get there.

That’s why I compiled this list music careers that make the most money. In this article I’m going to shed light on how to get the most fulfillment out of a career in music, how to make real money doing it, and offer practical steps to achieve your career goals. **Spoiler alert!** If you want to have a fulfilling music career that lasts, you should start doing all 5 of these.

Without further adieu, here’s my list of the 5 music careers that make the most money:

## 1. Songwriter

Songwriting is, without a doubt, a career that takes years of hard work and dedication to become an overnight success. The good news is we live in the 21st century, and there has never been a better time to be a songwriter.

In the last few years, we’ve seen a boom in digital media and online content that has increased the demand for original music.

**Consider this:**

2019 saw the launch of streaming services by Apple and Disney, each with a long list of fresh, original content. In 2020, we’ll see new streaming services by NBC, Discovery/BBC, and HBO, each with their own original content. Not to mention, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are ramping up their original content to compete with the new players in the game.

Another industry that is currently booming is _advertising_. With the exponential growth in digital and online content, there are more platforms for advertising. This goes beyond traditional commercials that interrupt TV shows and is spreading into ads that block Youtube videos, sponsored content on social media, and ads that interrupt us while browsing the web.

Most of these digital experiences are set to a soundtrack of original music.

> The world needs more songwriters.

The way songwriters make the majority of their money is by collecting royalties from the songs they write. For a closer look at the specifics, check out this article on [_how to make money as an independent songwriter_](/blog/how-to-make-money-as-an-independent-songwriter/).

## 2. Music Producer

The music producer is one of the more nebulous careers. It's often unclear to the uninitiated what a producer does, and it’s often intangible what a music producer contributes, but it is the _producer_ that has the power to take a _good_ recording and make it a _great_ recording.

Similar to a songwriter, producers can make royalties as well, but some music producers choose to charge by the day or by the hour in addition to collecting royalties.

Here’s a resource on [_how you can make money as a music producer_](/blog/how-to-make-money-as-a-music-producer/) that will walk you through making wise decisions early on that set you up for long-term success in your music career.

## 3. Recording Engineer

More than any other music career, being a recording engineer requires the most technical knowledge. A recording engineer oversees the technical and mechanical side of making music recordings. This can include making sure the microphones are placed correctly to get the desired sound, running the sound board, operating the recording software or tape machines, and sometimes mixing and mastering the final recordings.

## 4. Musician — Instrumentalist or vocalist

Musicians are the lifeblood of the music industry. They bring ideas to life and contribute ideas of their own to make something that is truly greater than the sum of its parts.

When I was younger, I dreamed of becoming a full-time musician, but I had no idea how to attain a career in music. I worked really hard, made some great connections, and eventually became a full-time musician. But even then, it didn’t _feel_ like I was a _professional_ musician.

Over the years, I found the key to building a lasting career as a musician, and I’m happy to share what I’ve learned. I put together an article on [how to make money as a musician](/blog/how-to-make-money-as-a-freelance-musician/) that will take a lot of the guesswork out of getting started, and give you the tools to make it last.

## 5. Music Teacher

Teachers have an important and often overlooked role in the music industry. They are highly effective at inspiring musicians to be their best, and there are so many life and career skills that can be learned from music. If you’re reading this and are wanting to make a career out of music, chances are you had a teacher or mentor that inspired you to be your best. That kind of encouragement sticks with you for life.

I’m a big fan of music teachers in a traditional sense of the word, but I’m also an advocate for anyone who can play an instrument or sing to be a music teacher to some capacity. Yes, teaching is a great way to sharpen your skills, so teach to get better. But **educational content on the internet is an amazing way to [grow your online following](/blog/how-musicians-can-grow-their-audience-with-content-marketing/) and broaden your marketing reach**.

## Why you should be doing all 5

Let me fill you in on the secret that musicians need to know to build sustainable, fulfilling music careers:

> You need to be a songwriting, music producing, well-rounded musician who can engineer your own recordings, and teach everything you know along the way.

There, I said it. Now you have no excuse not to be successful.

**Let me break it down for you.**

In case you didn’t know, the music industry has changed, and in my opinion, it has changed for the **better**. Never before have musicians been empowered to write, record, and self-publish their music with such a **low overhead cost**. Never before have musicians had platforms to launch their careers and grow their audience like they can with social media. The Internet, with all of its downsides, has paved the way for the independent musician to make a great living.

**Here’s a quick crash course on how the Internet works.**

There are two primary ways people use the Internet:

1. They visit or subscribe to some sort of web-based software that gives them some kind of value or entertainment.

2. They search keywords for questions they want answered.

Of course there are outliers and exceptions to this rule, but think about it. Everything you do on the internet, including mobile apps and podcasts, is centered around returning to somewhere you’ve already been, or searching keywords to find new places you haven’t been.

The _search_ is where you’ll find your strongest marketing power, and the way to get _found_ is by providing _value_ to people.

As I said previously:

> **Educational content is incredibly effective for marketing.**

If you can shift the way you think about making music for money, you can unlock growth potential you previously would never have experienced. Your album should not be your pinnacle product. The sold-out show should not be the end goal. The record deal should not be the ultimate stamp of approval. Yes, I want you to have all of these and more, but I also want you to **redefine success** for your own career. **[You don’t need a record label](/blog/how-to-get-a-record-deal-and-why-you-shouldnt/)** to fund your album if you can learn to write, produce, and engineer your own recordings. You don’t even need a band of musicians if you can learn just enough to be dangerous on a few instruments. If you can stretch yourself outside of your comfort zone, document your experience via a blog or videos, and be consistent with how often you post, you will inevitably build an audience that returns to your content because they find **_value_** in your content. And a lovely side effect is you’ll make it easy for people to _find_ your content on search engines.

Over time, your following will grow, and when you release your new music, guess what?

> They’ll pay you for it.

Maybe not all of them, but a percentage of them will. And if you self-publish and own your own masters, guess how much money you get to keep for yourself?

> All of it.

Keep writing, recording, documenting and teaching what you’ve learned, and your audience will keep growing. Release more music, and guess what?

> More people will pay you for it.

The cycle continues, and your audience grows along with your income.

**There are more reasons for you to do all 5 of these.**

### Music careers work best with a diversity of skills

**Let me tell you how having a diverse set of skills has worked in my favor.**

I studied music in college, and I’ll be completely honest — I learned everything that was useful for a music career from my dad, not college. He taught me the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Number_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_Nashville Number System_</a>, ear training, and how to dissect pop music part-by-part. When I was in college, I aced every class that had to do with music theory and ear training. My classes couldn't offer me much that my dad hadn’t already taught me. In fact, the most value I got out of college was the experience of living off campus in a house full of other musicians and audio engineers. Between my drums, their guitars, basses, and recording equipment, we had a fully equipped recording studio in our basement.

**It was a musician’s playground.**

I had a full-ride scholarship traveling in a band, so my weekends were spent on the road, and my week nights were spent writing and recording music. I could play enough of every instrument to materialize the ideas I had in my head and turn them into a recording. I learned how to write, produce, engineer, and play. I knew even before going to college that I wanted to move to a music city and make a career out of my music skills.

> Easier said than done.

A few friends of mine moved to Nashville during my senior year, and I got to witness them either succeed or fail as musicians. By the time I graduated, I decided that they didn’t experience the level of success that I wanted for myself, and I decided I should move to Los Angeles where more of the music I listened to was being made.

I packed up my SUV, mostly full of drums, guitars, and a few clothes, and drove across the country to Los Angeles.

> Launching a music career from the ground up was very difficult.

I met musicians and was able to secure a job at Apple to pay the bills, but it took years before I was a full-time musician.

**Having a diverse set of skills helped me get my career started.**

The first paying gig in LA was playing _guitar_ for an artist called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/musicbydavie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_Davie_</a>. He went to the same college as me, and he actually recognized me in an LA coffee shop from playing in the band I was in. We exchanged info, and he later hit me up to play a festival with him. I actually can’t remember how he figured out that I even _played_ guitar, much less that I was good enough to get payed to travel a long distance to back him up on it. He never had me audition or anything.

My second paying gig was also with Davie. I think he knew I was studying music production and audio engineering at a music school in LA, so he figured I must be able to engineer a recording for him. Just so happens we lived in the same neighborhood as me, and there was a decent recording studio down the street from my apartment. Their rates were really affordable if you brought your own engineer. He was smart and realized he could save a little money by hiring me to engineer rather than letting their in-house engineer record him.

We stayed in touch over the years while I was living in LA, and I eventually played drums for him a few times. But without having a diverse set of skills, my music career could have taken much longer to get off the ground.

### Here’s what a well-rounded music career could look like...

Having a diverse set of skills gives you more opportunities to _get hired_, but more importantly, **it gives you more opportunities to generate steady income**. Imagine being an instrumentalist that writes and teaches. Teaching private lessons typically generates steady, predictable income (cancellations aside). It’s also flexible, so you can still take paying gigs as a player. Even better, if you teach from the web, you can give lessons while on the road, giving you **double pay**. Through all of this, if you can keep steady writing sessions or continually write and record your own music, you can build up a repertoire that you can either license online or sell as a self-published project.

> Raw talent is not enough to make a sustainable music career.

You have to be disciplined to do things that don’t even seem musical or creative. But over time, dedication and discipline pay off more than talent ever could.
