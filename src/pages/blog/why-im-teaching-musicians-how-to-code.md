When the nation started to shut down due to Coronavirus, my heart really broke for musicians. I watched musicians not only lose their live music gigs, but I even saw many of them lose their coffee shop and restaurant side-jobs too.

It especially made me concerned when juxtaposed to my work situation. I've been blessed with a job that was minimally affected by the pandemic, which in turn meant that my life was minimally impacted as well. Sure, me and my family went into conserve mode and really buckled down our budget just to be safe. But I never went without a paycheck, and we didn't experience the stress of a looming layoff or furlough. 

I was spinning my wheels trying to figure out what I can do during these uncertain times to empower musicians to take hold of their careers and financial situations, even through the COVID shutdown.

I'm excited to announce that I've been working on a tutorial series to teach musicians how to code. I'm offering this [coding tutorial series](https://youtu.be/ZPiU4bRYznA) for **free** on Youtube, and I'm offering supplemental [products on my website](/#products) to take you further.

Let me share with you why I chose to make tutorial videos that empower musicians to learn how to code.

## Writing code his a high-paying skill

Before learning to code, I was in the same situation as many musicians were.  I was hopping from low-paying gig to low-paying gig, hoping something would take off and lead to a higher-paying gig.  If you've taken the time to read [my story](/short-story-long), you'll know that I eventually landed a full-time retainer gig — the golden unicorn for a freelance musician.  

For a short season, it offered me a great salary and job stability that meant I could quit my day job and focus on what I enjoyed most.  

However, when I was not asked back, it turned a lot of my security into doubt.  That's when I leaned into my tech skills and learned to code. I quickly realized that I could easily take another step up in salary by learning this new skill. 

> Entry-level developers make more than the average musician on retainer.

If you can even land a retainer gig these days, you'll quickly cap out on your salary. **Not only do beginners make more at coding than the most prodigious musician-for-hire, but there is a lot of room for growth.** 

## You can write code anywhere

Let’s assume you’re not ready to give up your fun, adventurous rock-and-roll lifestyle. **You can still write code as a part-time side hustle.**

There is plenty of opportunity to write code part-time while on the road or in conjunction with a session schedule. And with how flexible tech companies can be, I wouldn't be surprised if there are developer jobs out there that can be managed at a full-time capacity while on tour (if touring is still a thing).

>Double pay anyone?

## You can make good money without sacrificing your dreams

It is completely possible to have stable, reliable source of *solid* income, and have the creative gratification of being a musician. 

>Your schedule might look different, but your goals don't have to.

If I'm being honest, I'd really like to make more music than I currently do. But the other side of that coin is I'm making progress on my financial goals that wouldn't have been possible with music alone. I'll soon be able to build out a studio in my home that will be my creative haven. I'll be able to afford gear I previously would have to skimp on. I'll be able to make recordings I'm proud of and offer my services for a premium price, or [sell my own music independently](/blog/how-to-sell-your-music-independently/) if I so choose.

To sum it up, right now my schedule looks like I'm a developer and not much of a musician. But that's not where I'm headed, it's *how* I'm getting there.

I hope this has inspired your to learn how to code, or at least to consider a [side hustle](/blog/the-best-side-jobs-for-freelance-musicians/) to help you achieve your goals or to help you get out of a tough spot.
