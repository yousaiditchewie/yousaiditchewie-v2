Being an independent musician can be a challenging career endeavor, especially since there isnâ€™t a clear path into making money doing it. But the good news is we live in the 21st century, and there has never been a better time to be a musician.

What gives me hope about songwriting today is that there are more opportunities to sell your music than there were five, ten, or fifteen years ago. With the exponential growth of digital media and online content, there is exponential need for fresh songs to enhance those experiences.

> Think about it.

Have you ever tried to watch a video on Youtube, and before it began, you were interrupted by an ad?

Have you ever binged _The Bachelor in Paradise_ on Hulu, and all the drama and excitement gets put on hold for a commercial every ten minutes?

Have you ever scrolled Instagram and found yourself watching a compelling video only to realize itâ€™s a **sponsored post!?!?**

Have you played whatever Nintendo game the kids play these days?

Thereâ€™s a really good chance all of these digital experiences are set to a soundtrack of _original_ music.

> Original content needs original music.

**Songwriters to the rescue!**

## Thereâ€™s more to songwriting than just money

But donâ€™t get me wrong, there are plenty of ways songwriters can make money.

One of the perks that comes with songwriting is being able to create art that really _means_ something to people. They get to put their songs out in the world and see how people respond to them. Most of the time, people wonâ€™t make take the time to let a songwriter know how _bad_ their song was, but they will most likely do this for a song they love.

Thereâ€™s also a lot of earning potential for songwriters, assuming your songs are available through the right channels.

## How much money can a songwriter make?

The truth is that there is no fixed salary for a songwriter, which can be a good thing or a bad thing. Usually songwriters donâ€™t make money until their songs have been placed in a video, or records are sold, or songs are streamed.

Here are some key data points to consider:

<small>\*_I've done a lot of research on this topic, and I'll do my best to keep this article up-to-date, but make sure to do your own research before making any major decisions with your music or your career._</small>

### Streaming services typically pay between $0.004 and $0.01 per stream.

You read that right.

> A penny per stream is on the **high** end.

Thatâ€™s pretty much a negligible amount of money per stream. The only way to make _real_ money on streaming platforms is to:

1. Write songs that people like.
2. Have a **really big** fan base.
3. Write a **lot** of songs that people like.

Easier said than done, but the good news is, streaming services arenâ€™t the only way to make money as a songwriter.

To shed light on some of the actual dollars this amounts to, consider "Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift. According to this article by CNBC regarding <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/how-spotify-apple-music-can-pay-musicians-more-commentary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making money on Spotify and Apple</a>, the mega hit had 46.3 million streams that, according to the math above, earned in the ballpark of $300,000.  Itâ€™s possible that with people listening to the entire album, she made $1 Million or more on streaming services alone. Thatâ€™s exceptionally good money for a songwriter, but thereâ€™s one problem.

> Youâ€™re not T-Swift.

The average songwriter will _not_ release one album every three years and expect the royalties from that album to keep them afloat financially until the next album releases. Itâ€™s just not realistic.

If youâ€™re just getting started in your career as a songwriter, streaming should be _part_ of your money-making strategy, but it should not be the _only_ part of your money-making strategy.

### Mechanical/Sync royalties pay about $0.09 per track or $0.0175 for each minute played.

The term **mechanical royalty** is a term used to describe what is owed to a songwriter when their song is sold as a physical product, and meant a lot more when the primary medium for music was LP records, cassette tapes, and CD's.

**Sync royalty** is a term used to describe what is owed to a songwriter when their song is _synchronized_ to another medium, most commonly, video â€” film and television.

Mechanical royalties are a dwindling form of income for most artists with the exception of artists that market themselves as Country artists or Christian/Gospel artists (fans of those genres are still purchasing physical copies of albums in large numbers). Most songwriters these days completely disregard producing physical versions of their music in favor of digital distribution through iTunes, for instance, or streaming services, such as AppleMusic or Spotify. But know that if you do choose to produce physical versions of your music, **you are entitled to at least \$0.09 each song per unit sold**.

> The infamous sync royalty

The sync royalty is highly sought-after these days, and rightfully so. Getting a song placed on a popular TV show or in a movie is basically the _golden unicorn_ for a songwriter. As mentioned above, sync royalties pay about \$0.0175 per minute played, but thereâ€™s an incredibly powerful phenomenon at work behind film and TV.

> Someone else pays for marketing and advertising.

All a songwriter has to do is come up with a mutually beneficial agreement with a filmmaker, studio, or network, and all the sudden, the songâ€™s success is married to the success of the video (and in case you didnâ€™t know, the entertainment industry hates losing money).

Ok, so before that can happen, you have to write an amazing song, make sure the right people hear it, and know how much money is _fair_ for you to make from it. Iâ€™m not the expert in writing _hit_ songs, but I wrote an article on [growing your audience with content marketing](/blog/how-musicians-can-grow-their-audience-with-content-marketing/) that can help you get your music in front of the right people.

### Online licensing services are growing in popularity

Online services such as <a href="https://www.musicbed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Musicbed</a> make it really easy for artists to upload music to be discovered by filmmakers.

> But wait, thereâ€™s more.

Google "music bed", and youâ€™ll see half a dozen paid search ads for other services that do the **exact same thing!**

These services have their own terms, conditions, and licensing agreements, so get informed before uploading your music (some may include an _exclusivity clause_ that prevents you from uploading your music to competitor services). But the more successful they are at providing quality music for filmmakers, the more successful your music will be.

## Hereâ€™s how you can start making money as a songwriter

### Start writing songs

Literally anyone can be a songwriter if you just **write songs**.

If you havenâ€™t started writing, just do it.

### Be consistent

What separates a hobbyist from a professional is _diligence and consistency_.

> Making money writing songs is a numbers game.

The more songs you write, the better youâ€™ll get at song writing, and the more material youâ€™ll have to offer. The more songs you write that get placed in film or television, the more chances you have to make **passive income** â€” thatâ€™s money coming in that youâ€™re no longer working for. Do you see how writing quality songs perpetuates the ability to generate income from writing quality songs?

ðŸ¤¯

If youâ€™re predominantly an instrumentalist, like a drummer or a guitarist, just try it out and see if you surprise yourself with what you can write. If you can "finish" a song, no matter the quality, youâ€™ll be inspired to write another, and trust me, youâ€™ll get better and better. Even if itâ€™s only instrumental music, thereâ€™s plenty of need for instrumental music for film, TV, video games, and apps.

Another perk of being able to write songs, even as an instrumentalist, is that you can showcase your skills with your own music. My first gigs as a drummer in LA were largely due to the fact that I had music to show people. I canâ€™t give _all_ the credit to my songwriting skills, but I at least had original music recorded so that I could show people what I sound like.

### Release music often

There are a lot of mixed opinions about how often to release music, but Iâ€™m of the mindset that early in your songwriting career, you need to **release often**.

Having a lot of original content available gives you an advantage in a few ways:

1. You get _practice_ writing songs.
2. You develop a _taste_ for the songs you like to write.
3. You have the _appearance_ of being experienced.
4. You have more _opportunities_ for your music to be heard by someone who will pay for it (consumers or other creatives).

Imagine a continuum where on one side you have "craft", and on the other you have "content" â€” quality and quantity. Early on, you should lean more on generating quantity, and expect that quality will develop over time.

> Do not save your "good stuff" for later in your career.<br /> **Release it now!**

If youâ€™ve read my article on [content marketing](/blog/how-musicians-can-grow-their-audience-with-content-marketing/), youâ€™ll know that having more content on the internet means more people can _find_ you, either through searching on the internet or by discovery algorithms on social media platforms (Instagram and Youtube).

Quality can wait till later. If you want to start making money as a songwriter, focus on **quantity** for now.
