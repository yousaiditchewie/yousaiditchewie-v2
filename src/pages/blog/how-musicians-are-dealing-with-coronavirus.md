I hope you’re staying healthy and safe during this time of social distancing and quarantining. These times can bring a lot of uncertainty and financial stress for musicians, and that’s not lost on me. 

If you’re struggling to make ends meat, check out my article on [making money while under quarantine](https://www.yousaiditchewie.com/blog/how-musicians-can-make-money-while-quarantined/). 

I wanted to take a few minutes to highlight some musicians who are taking proverbial lemons and making lemonade (and selling it). I hope you find hope and inspiration from these people, so that you can stay sharp and inspired while staying inside, so that you can come out of this **ahead** of where you were before it all started.

 Songwriter, producer and recording engineer, [Jordan Ruiz](http://thejordanruiz.com) has had a great few months, and released various albums, singles, and ep’s with artists. He’s ramped up his recording setup to make a more creative space for riding the waves of inspiration.

## Dan Bailey

Dan is an amazing session and touring drummer. He’s also made a few courses that he sells that teach his method of approaching his drum sounds and musical ideas. He’s dropped the price for his [drum courses](http://www.drichardbailey.com/) which no doubt is helping him gain customers, but it’s also helping people by giving them useful information at a discounted price. 

> You’re not a bad person if helping people also helps yourself. That’s how business works. 

## Here’s what I’m doing

I’ve been pivoting a lot when it comes to writing content and publishing articles. If you’re subscribed to my newsletter, you may (or may not) have noticed I haven’t sent an email in a couple of weeks. This is mostly due to a lack of clarity on how I can co tribute something valuable. I’m not a medical expert, economic expert, or anything like that. 

What I can do is make music and write code. I’ve been kicking around ideas for tools to help musicians stay creative and collaborate with each other while isolated. I even started building an iOS app. However, I found it to be very difficult to accomplish the key functionality I was aiming for. 

> So I pivoted yet again. 

I want musicians to experience the same stability I’ve been afforded by learning to code, which is why I’ve decided to start working on coding tutorials geared towards web developers, like myself, who want to get into native iOS development with Swift. 

I’ll keep you posted on my progress, but if that’s something that interests you, subscribe to my newsletter below for more updates.
