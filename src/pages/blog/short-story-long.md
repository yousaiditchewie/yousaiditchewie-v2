## Music was everything

When I was about 14, I made an amazing discovery — some people got paid to make music. The concept was so foreign to me. _How was it possible to make money doing something so fun? Wasn’t work supposed to be boring?_
I spent the next few years reading _[Modern Drummer Magazine](https://www.moderndrummer.com)_, watching music documentaries, and pursuing relationships with as many "professional" musicians as I could. I had to make this my career.
In my pursuit of a career in music, I heard it over and over again.

> You need a **REAL JOB**.

y tho...

There's this magazine that comes out every month that’s filled cover-to-cover with success story after success story. How could it work for all of these people and not me?

## Fast forward

I got a music degree. That's how you learn the necessary skills, right?

> **WRONG.**

I moved to Los Angeles. That's where everyone goes to find success, right?

> **WRONG.**

I met the right people, played in the right places and landed a full-time retainer gig. That means I made it right?

## Downturn

I spent a short time "living the dream" as a full-time touring and session drummer. It really wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. There are plenty of people who can thrive in a touring environment, and I can confidently say, I’m not one of them. I love structure, predictability, and stability. You get none of these on the road, and it puts pressure on your relationships.\
I wasn't asked back after a leg of tour ended. Just like that, I was no longer a full-time musician.
I looked for other opportunities as a songwriter, producer, or engineer in addition to drumming gigs.

> Nothing came up.

## NASA, of all things

Here’s the crazy thing. Before landing that retainer gig, I worked at [Apple](https://www.apple.com) as a Mac technician. As it turned out, a company that handled an IT contract with [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov) was desperate for Mac technicians. Somehow, _they_ found _me_ while I was looking for work, and I landed a job there. I got to be an on-site technician for actual rocket scientists.

> It sounds exciting, but I was helping geriatric astrophysicists print stuff.

Just kidding, it was super exciting. One of the coolest parts was that I got to talk to software engineers while I was helping them with their computers. They did crazy stuff like giving a robot on Mars instructions for the next 12 hours of its Martian day.

My time at Apple made me think of software developers as the tech rock stars of our generation. Working at NASA made me see just how far software could take you.

I got this crazy idea to quit my job and learn how to code. With the support of my pregnant wife, I did just that.

## Landing my first dev job was hard

Really hard. Everyone wanted 3-5 years of experience for an entry-level role. With a lot of hard work and dedication, I landed two part-time jobs — one at a tech startup, and one at a marketing agency. Two very different companies that were doing a lot of the same things. They were both growing an audience and turning them into paying customers. I learned how to turn business goals into code, and I got to watch it work (for the most pat — the tech startup went under).

Eventually, I took a job for a company in Nashville, where I currently live and work. Through my journey, I learned a few key things.

> Ditch the hype, find **freedom**.

You don’t have to sacrifice creative gratification for financial stability — **you can have both**.

> The Internet is a **big** place.

There’s still plenty of space, and it’s a great platform to launch a business.

> **Content** is the key.

Freelance musicians need to learn how to turn the internet into their music venue. When they do, they can turn their audience into customers and life-long fans.
