Being an independent musician can be a challenging career endeavor, especially since there isnâ€™t a clear path into making money doing it. But the good news is we live in the 21st century, and there has never been a better time to be a musician.

Whatâ€™s really interesting about being a songwriter is that there are more opportunities to sell your music today than there were five, ten, or fifteen years ago. With the exponential growth of digital media and online content, there is exponential need for fresh songs to enhance those experiences.

> Think about it.

Have you ever tried to watch a video on Youtube, and before it began, you were interrupted by an ad?

Have you ever binged _The Bachelor in Paradise_ on Hulu, and all the drama and excitement gets put on hold for a commercial every ten minutes?

Have you ever scrolled Instagram and found yourself watching a compelling video only to realize itâ€™s a **sponsored post!?!?**

Have you played whatever Nintendo game the kids play these days?

Thereâ€™s a really good chance all of these digital experiences are set to a soundtrack of _original_ music.

> Original content needs original music.

**Songwriters to the rescue!**

## Being a songwriter has more perks than just money

There is a lot of fulfillment that comes with creating art that really _means_ something to people. Songwriters get to do this. They get to put their songs out in the world and see how people respond to them. Most of the time, people wonâ€™t make take the time to let a songwriter know how _bad_ their song was, but they will most likely do this for a song they love.

Thereâ€™s also a lot of earning potential for songwriters, assuming your songs are available through the right channels.

## How much money can a songwriter make?

The truth is that there is no fixed salary for a songwriter, which can be a good thing or a bad thing. Usually songwriters donâ€™t make money until their songs have been placed in a video, or records are sold, or songs are streamed.

Here are some key data points to consider:

<small>\*_I need to preface this by saying, I've done a lot of research on this topic, and I'll do my best to keep the content up-to-date, but keep in mind these numbers are subject to change._</small>

### Streaming services typically pay between $0.004 and $0.01 per stream.

You read that right.

> A penny per stream is on the **high** end.

Thatâ€™s basically an insulting amount of money, but the good news is, streaming services arenâ€™t the only way to get heard or paid.

To shed light on some of the actual dollars this amounts to, consider "Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift. According to this article by CNBC regarding [Spotify and Apple Music payouts](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/how-spotify-apple-music-can-pay-musicians-more-commentary.html), the mega hit had 46.3 million streams that earned in the ballpark of $300,000.  Itâ€™s possible that with people listening to the entire album, she made $1 Million or more on streaming services alone. Thatâ€™s exceptionally good money for a songwriter, but thereâ€™s one problem.

> Youâ€™re not T-Swift.

The average songwriter will not release one album every three years and expect the royalties from that album to keep them afloat financially until the next album releases. Itâ€™s just not realistic.

If youâ€™re just getting started in your career as a songwriter, streaming should be _part_ of your money-making strategy, but it should most definitely not be the _only_ part of your money-making strategy.

### Mechanical/Sync royalties pay about $0.09 per track or $0.0175 for each minute played.

The term **mechanical royalty** is a term used to describe what is owed to a songwriter when their song is sold as a physical product, and meant a lot more when the primary medium for music was LP records, cassette tapes, and CD's.

**Sync royalty** is a term used to describe what is owed to a songwriter when their song is _synchronized_ to another medium, most commonly, video â€” film and television.

Mechanical royalties are a dwindling form of income for most artists with the exception of artists that market themselves as Country artists or Christian/Gospel artists (fans of those genres are still purchasing physical copies of albums in large numbers). Most songwriters these days completely disregard producing physical versions of their music in favor of digital distribution through iTunes, for instance, or streaming services, such as AppleMusic or Spotify. But know that if you do choose to produce physical versions of your music, **you are entitled to at least \$0.09 each song per unit sold**.

> The infamous sync royalty

The sync royalty is highly sought-after these days, and rightfully so. Getting a song placed on a popular TV show or in a movie is basically the _golden unicorn_ for a songwriter. As mentioned above, sync royalties pay about \$0.0175 per minute played, but thereâ€™s an incredibly powerful phenomenon at work behind film and TV.

> Someone else pays for marketing and advertising.

All a songwriter has to do is come up with a mutually beneficial agreement with a filmmaker, studio, or network, and all the sudden, the songâ€™s success is married to the success of the video (and in case you didnâ€™t know, the entertainment industry hates losing money).

Ok, so before that can happen, you have to write an amazing song, make sure the right people hear it, and know how much money is _fair_ for you to make from it. Iâ€™m not the expert in writing hit songs, but I wrote an article on [how to market your music independently](####) that can help you get your music in front of the right people.

### Online licensing services are growing in popularity

Online services such as [Musicbed](https://www.musicbed.com/) make it really easy for artists to upload music to be discovered by filmmakers.

> But wait, thereâ€™s more.

Google "music bed", and youâ€™ll see half a dozen paid search ads for other services that do the **exact same thing!**

These services have their own terms, conditions, and licensing agreements, so get informed before uploading your music (some may include an _exclusivity clause_ that prevents you from uploading your music to competitor services). But the more successful they are at providing quality music for filmmakers, the more successful your music will be.

## Hereâ€™s how you can make money as a songwriter

Literally anyone can be a songwriter if you just **write songs**.

What separates a hobbyist from a professional is _diligence and consistency_.

> Song writing is a numbers game.

The more songs you write, the better youâ€™ll get at song writing, and the more material youâ€™ll have to offer. The more songs you write that get placed in film or television, the more chances you have to make **passive income** â€” thatâ€™s money coming in that youâ€™re no longer working for. Do you see how writing quality songs perpetuates the ability to generate income from writing quality songs?

ðŸ¤¯

If youâ€™re predominantly an instrumentalist, like a drummer or a guitarist, just try it out and see if you surprise yourself with what you can write. If you can "finish" a song, no matter the quality, youâ€™ll be inspired to write another, and trust me, youâ€™ll get better and better. Even if itâ€™s only instrumental music, thereâ€™s plenty of need for instrumental music for film, TV, video games, and apps.
