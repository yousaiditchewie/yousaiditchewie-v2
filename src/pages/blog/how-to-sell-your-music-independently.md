In years past, the best way to sell your music was to produce some sort of physical product, and the cheapest way to produce a physical product was to get a record label to invest in your music.

> Those days are over.

I've already explained [why you shouldn’t get a record deal](/blog/how-to-get-a-record-deal-and-why-you-shouldnt) in another article, so I want to take some time explaining what you _should_ be doing to sell your music independently.

Selling music, or any other product for that matter, requires an understanding of three basic mechanisms: **sales channels, marketing channels, and product strategy**. Once you understand the purpose and importance of each, you can allow your creativity to flourish to unlock their potential.

## Sales channels for music

In short, a **sales channel** is any means of getting your product into the hands of customers, consumers, or if the case of musicians, fans. In the digital age, there are plenty to choose from. Let me start by explaining the most obvious sales channel, and then I’ll shed light on a few that may not be as obvious.

### Streaming services

No surprises here. If you’re a musician, you’d better have a presence on Spotify or Apple Music. When it comes to getting your music into a platform like Spotify, you need to establish a relationship with a licensing and distribution company. While most record labels will handle licensing and distribution for their artists, there are companies that can provide these services independently from record labels. Spotify makes it easy and provides a list of <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/directory/distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preferred artist distributors</a>.

### Online licensing

Speaking of licensing, the online licensing industry is booming right now. One of the biggest players in the game is <a href="https://www.musicbed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Bed</a>.
