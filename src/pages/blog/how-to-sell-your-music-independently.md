In years past, the best way to sell your music was to produce some sort of physical product, and the cheapest way to produce a physical product was to get a record label to invest in your music.

> Those days are over.

I've already explained [why you shouldn’t get a record deal](/blog/how-to-get-a-record-deal-and-why-you-shouldnt) in another article, so I want to take some time explaining what you _should_ be doing to sell your music independently.

Selling music, or any other product for that matter, requires an understanding of three basic mechanisms: **sales channels, marketing channels, and product strategy**. Once you understand the purpose and importance of each, you can allow your creativity to flourish to unlock their potential.

## Sales channels for music

In short, a **sales channel** is any means of getting your product into the hands of customers, consumers, or if the case of musicians, fans. In the digital age, there are plenty to choose from. Let me start by explaining the most obvious sales channel, and then I’ll shed light on a few that may not be as obvious.

### Streaming services

No surprises here. If you’re a musician, you’d better have a presence on Spotify or Apple Music. When it comes to getting your music into a platform like Spotify, you need to establish a relationship with a licensing and distribution company. While most record labels will handle licensing and distribution for their artists, there are companies that can provide these services independently from record labels. Spotify makes it easy and provides a list of <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/directory/distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preferred artist distributors</a>.

### Online licensing

Speaking of licensing, the online licensing industry is booming right now. One of the biggest players in the game is <a href="https://www.musicbed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Bed</a>.

> But wait, there’s more.

Seriously, just do a Google search for "music bed", and you’ll see tons of ads for their competitors. I mention in my article about [how to make money as a songwriter](/blog/how-to-make-money-as-an-independent-songwriter/) that there is a growing need for original music with the rise in all of the digital content platforms (Netflix, Apple TV +, Disney +, you name it). Services like Music Bed operate as a platform that connects musicians with videographers.

### Gumroad

<a href="https://gumroad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gumroad</a> is an ecommerce solution for creatives. While it is not explicitly a music ecommerce platform, it serves musicians well. Without getting too technical, it acts as a safe host for digital assets, such as a digital album, and offers secure payments that will then deliver the digital assets to the purchaser. This is a process we take for granted in the age of the internet, but let me assure you, even ecommerce juggernauts like Shopify and WordPress don’t have a process for delivering digital assets as refined as Gumroad.

A platform like Gumroad also opens the doors for you to think outside of the box with your product lineup. I’ll expound on this later, but with Gumroad, you can offer exclusive packages and bundles of products that are impossible with Spotify and Apple Music, and would require tons of plugins and add-ons for Shopify and WordPress.

> **Shopify**: ecommerce platform.<br>**Spotify**: streaming platform.<br>It’s not confusing at all.

You can see Gumroad in action on my home page where I’m selling bundles of [loop packs](/#products).

## Marketing channels for music

If sales channels are all about getting people to buy your products, marketing channels are all about making people _aware_ that you have products to sell. To take it one step further, marketing is letting people know you _exist_ and that you have something _valuable_ to add to the marketplace.

Here are some common marketing channels you need to utilize for your music.

### Email marketing

This is a big one, and probably the one most overlooked by musicians. It seems a little cheesy to send people emails and keep up an ongoing list to send to, but here’s the truth about email marketing:

> More people are purchasing through emails than any other marketing channel.

It just works.

The great news is that a free account with a CRM (customer relationship manager) is enough to get you started. I’m currently still on the free tier of <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailchimp</a>, and it’s still meeting all of my needs.

It helps to have a website where people can sign up for your mailing list, and luckily, I’m a software engineer, so I can build my own website from scratch for free. However, I’ve built plenty of websites for freelance projects using <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wix</a>, and they offer low prices for a fully functional website with _free_ themes, and guess what? They have a built-in CRM complete with sign up forms. It’s a great option to get a website and an email list spun up at the same time for not a lot of money.

Blog capabilities are another perk to having a website to feed your email list, which leads me to the next marketing channel...

### Content marketing

Content marketing is another **very important** marketing channel. It’s sort of the one-two-punch when paired with email marketing. In fact, it's so important, that I wrote a detailed article on [how musicians can grow their audience with content marketing](/blog/how-musicians-can-grow-their-audience-with-content-marketing/). It unpacks practical ways musicians can increase their fans and turn them into repeat customers.

You should check out the article for full details, but here’s a high-level overview.

There are two primary ways people use the internet:

1. They repeatedly visit a trusted site either for entertainment or information (this includes mobile apps and social media).

2. They _search_ to find answers to their questions.

**Content marketing positions your brand or your product to be _found_ when people are searching.**

Another perk of a platform like Wix is that you get blog capabilities out of the gate, which can play a huge role in your content marketing strategy and grow your email list.

### Social media marketing

Social media is another marketing channel musicians need to utilize. The good news is that most musicians are aware of its power because most musicians are _on_ social media.

> Instagram anyone?

The downside of social media is that very few social platforms actually convert followers into customers, but they are great at building awareness around your brand or product. The best part of a platform like Instagram is that people get to _see_ you doing what you do best.

Again, I dive deeper into the role social media plays in [growing your audience with content marketing](/blog/how-musicians-can-grow-their-audience-with-content-marketing/), so read the article for more details.

## Product strategy for music

When I was studying audio engineering, one of my teachers took time to rant about how music is an _art_, not a _product_. I got really sucked into the rant and event bought into it for a long time. But later, I came to the realization that **it costs money** to see the most cherished works of art.

> The Louvre charges for admission.

Music is an art _**and**_ music is a product. **The two are not mutually exclusive**.

Musicians need to view their craft with the same delicacy of any art form while simultaneously thinking of ways to sell it as a product. Here are a few ideas to get you started.

### The LP album

For anyone born later than 1990, LP stands for **Long Play**. It is the penultimate for most musicians when it comes to creative expression. Here’s a crazy idea...

> What if you turned it into a product?

Like, really went all out for your LP?

In the days of physical products, there was a lot of thought and intentionality put into album liner notes that came with CD’s, cassettes, and vinyl records. **Let’s bring that back, people!**

Let’s call out all of the musicians, engineers, designers, and creatives that contributed to your album.

> But, Yousaiditchewie, how can we do this? Our music is on Apple Music and Spotify where people don’t care about such things!

I’m so glad you asked.

I mentioned Gumroad in a section above, and here’s where it comes into play. When you sell digital products on a platform that is completely agnostic to your product format, you can offer the highest quality experience for your products at a premium cost.

Here’s what I mean. There is literally nowhere you can go to buy digital music at full-resolution complete with album artwork and liner notes. The best part is that selling on a platform like Gumroad allows you to sell independently from a record label and take **nearly all** of your revenue to keep for yourself, assuming you own your own masters. Gumroad takes a percentage of purchases as payment processing fees, which is common for any ecommerce platform, but in my opinion, that’s a small price to pay for owning your own masters and self-publishing your own music.

Let’s take this a step further.

### "Sawdust" from the LP

I heard a story, and I don’t know if it’s true, but it’s too inspiring for me to google it and find it to be a lie.

As the story goes, there was a lumber company that was spending a lot of money disposing of their sawdust — a byproduct. Someone in the company discovered that they could glue the sawdust together in a specific way to make a solid, durable board that could be sold as a product on its own.

> Plywood.

If that story is true, and I like to believe it is, musicians need to apply its principles to their music. **Your album is a product that generates many byproducts you can sell**.

Your album likely includes beats that can be sold as a _library_. Those beats are made of sounds that can be sold as _samples_. Your time spent writing, recording, mixing, mastering and collaborating are opportunities to shoot a _making-of documentary_ or a _how-to tutorial_.

> People pay for these products all the time.

Here’s the beauty of sales channels and marketing channels. If you have an audience, all you have to do is inform people about your products, tell them where to purchase, give them options, and people will purchase whatever _they_ want.

There are parts of your creative process that you would have to spend time and resources on anyway, so there’s little to no additional cost for you to package them up and sell them. And if you price them appropriately, you’ll most likely make better money on those products than you will on streaming platforms alone. I break down how the math works in my article on [how to get a record deal and why you shouldn’t](/blog/how-to-get-a-record-deal-and-why-you-shouldnt).

## Go forth and sell your music independently

I’m a big advocate for _starting_ independent and _staying_ independent. **You don’t need to pay a record label to do things you can do for free**.
