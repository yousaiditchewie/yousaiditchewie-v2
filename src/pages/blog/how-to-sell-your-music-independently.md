In years past, the best way to sell your music was to produce some sort of physical product, and the cheapest way to produce a physical product was to get a record label to invest in your music.

> Those days are over.

I've already explained [why you shouldnâ€™t get a record deal](/blog/how-to-get-a-record-deal-and-why-you-shouldnt) in another article, so I want to take some time explaining what you _should_ be doing to sell your music independently.

Selling music, or any other product for that matter, requires an understanding of three basic mechanisms: **sales channels, marketing channels, and product strategy**. Once you understand the purpose and importance of each, you can allow your creativity to flourish to unlock their potential.
