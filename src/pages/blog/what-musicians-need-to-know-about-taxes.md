I get it, you're busy. **Join the club**. Just don’t get burned this tax season.

The first year me and my wife were married, we each had two regular W-2 jobs, I landed my first full-time music gig, and I had lots of freelance work on top of that.

> Our taxes were complicated.

It was actually so complicated that I completely forgot to file one of my wife’s W-2's, **and we didn't know about it until almost two years later.** We owed a lot of money that we hadn't accounted for, and it was a huge burden that could have been avoided.

To save you, my fellow musicians, from a lot of unnecessary pain, here’s a few things you should know about filing your taxes.

## 1. It’s OK to get help

Sometimes software will totally do the trick, but your taxes might be complicated enough that you need a pro to make sure you’re not forgetting something (or saving money in a way you didn’t know you could).

Luckily, there's a great new onine resource to help you decide which route to take.

I took the quiz and found that I can easily use software for my taxes, and guess what? They've also got an online tool for that that’s cheaper than TurboTax and doesn't try to up-sell you every ten seconds. I had a great experience with it, and you should consider using it instead of TurboTax this year.

## 2. Keep records of your expenses and gear

Most musicians know to keep a record throughout the year so that they're prepared when it's time to do their taxes. If that’s you, **great job!** Even if you keep good records of what you can write off, there are probably a few items you _should_ write off that you weren’t aware of.

For musicians, we often buy big ticket items like instruments, gear, and electronics that last us years and years before we stop using them (if we ever stop using them). These items typically depreciate in value, but they may still qualify as a tax write off as long as you are using them. So it also helps to keep track of what you payed for bigger items, and what they’re currently worth.

Here’s an article by TubroTax that’s really helpful when it comes to filing taxes as a musician. Just don't get sucked into using their software this year. Try the other software I mentioned earlier.
