I get it, you're busy. **Join the club**. Just donâ€™t get burned this tax season.

The first year me and my wife were married, we each had two regular W-2 jobs, I landed my first full-time music gig, and I had lots of freelance work on top of that.

> Our taxes were complicated.

It was actually so complicated that I completely forgot to file one of my wifeâ€™s W-2's, **and we didn't know about it until almost two years later.** We owed a lot of money that we hadn't accounted for, and it was a huge burden that could have been avoided.

To save you, my fellow musicians, from a lot of unnecessary pain, hereâ€™s a few things you should know about filing your taxes.

## 1. Itâ€™s OK to get help

Sometimes software will totally do the trick, but your taxes might be complicated enough that you need a pro to make sure youâ€™re not forgetting something (or saving money in a way you didnâ€™t know you could).

Luckily, there's a great new online resource to help you decide which route to take. Financial guru, Dave Ramsey just came out with a [tax assessment quiz](https://www.daveramsey.com/elp/tax-preparation). It helps you determine if your taxes are simple enough that software is a good option or complicated enough that you should have a pro take a look at them.

I took the quiz and found that I can easily use software for my taxes, and guess what? They also offer online tax software thatâ€™s cheaper than TurboTax and doesn't try to up-sell you every ten seconds. I had a great experience with it, and you should consider using it instead of TurboTax this year.

## 2. Keep records of your expenses and gear

Most musicians know to keep a record of expenses throughout the year so that they're prepared when it's time to do their taxes. If thatâ€™s you, **great job!** But even if you keep good records of what you can write off, there are probably a few items you _should_ write off that you werenâ€™t aware of.

For musicians, we often buy big-ticket items like instruments, gear, and electronics that last us years and years before we stop using them (if we ever stop using them). These items typically depreciate in value and may qualify as a tax deduction **for as long as we use them**. So you need to take inventory of the expensive gear you use, keep track of what you payed for them, and know what theyâ€™re currently worth.

Hereâ€™s an article by TubroTax thatâ€™s really helpful when it comes to <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/self-employment-taxes/the-musicians-guide-to-taxes-top-tax-deductions/L3dFXFokF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filing taxes as a musician</a>. Just don't get sucked into using their software without first trying the software I mentioned above ðŸ‘†.

Maybe your problem is wanting more money, so you can buy more gear. Check out my article on [music careers that make the most money](/blog/music-careers-that-make-the-most-money/).

## 3. Donâ€™t be late

April 15, 2020 is a Wednesday, and itâ€™s rapidly approaching. If you know youâ€™re going to owe money for your taxes when you file them, save up some money ahead of time, so itâ€™s less of a financial burden. Another benefit of tax software is that you can line up all of your tax information, know what you'll owe (or get back), and save your progress to file later. This gives you a great picture of what you need to save up without having to write a check immediately. It also saves you from needing to run out for a postage stamp.

You may be wondering how this affects your taxes, so let me break it down for you. You canâ€™t deduct damaged instruments or gear on your taxes _this_ year, but you can when you file your taxes _next_ year.
