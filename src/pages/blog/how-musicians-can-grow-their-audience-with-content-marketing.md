## What is content marketing?

I didn't study marketing in school or get a degree in communications or whatever the kids call it these days. I got a music degree, and I really wish I hadn’t. You can read [my story](/blog/short-story-long/) if you’re really interested.

> Insert shameless plug for you to subscribe to my [**mailing list**](#sign-up).

However, after transitioning my career from studio/session drummer to software engineer, I learned a lot about how the Internet works and how to use it to grow a following. Have you ever wondered how it’s possible to make a career out of blogging?

> Insta-famous? _**ew**_.

_Like what is a public figure anyway? How does one get into public figuring?_

Here’s the bottom line. **People who generate valuable content on a consistent basis will inevitably have a large following.** This principle applies to blogging, Instagram, Youtube, and any other social platform on the web.

You may never be a Jenner or a Jonas, but you can grow your following by generating content on a consistent basis that offers value to people.

> **Content marketing** is the process of planning, creating, distributing, sharing, and publishing content to reach your target audience. As a business, this tactic can help you improve brand awareness, boost sales, connect with your target audience members, and engage prospects and customers.

I took that quote from a HubSpot article about [content marketing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing), and it is _HubSpot_-on!

This is my blog and I can dad-joke if I want.

I got HubSpot certified at the marketing agency that gave me my first real developer job (another part of [my story](/blog/short-story-long)), and it changed the way I think about the web. There’s this crazy thing that happens when you stop thinking about what you can _get_ from your audience, and start thinking about how you can _help the most people_. When you start offering valuable information to people, they’ll buy things from you (albums, ep’s, merch, lessons), and they’ll keep coming back to you as a resource (read: lifelong fan).

> Provide value to people, and they’ll thank you with their wallets.

## How can content marketing help musicians?

This blog is for anyone who will read it, but my intended audience is the freelance musician (guitar, bass, drums, keys, vocals), songwriter, recording engineer, ect. — basically, the makers of music. I constantly heard that being a musician is **not** a viable career choice, and I’ll need to get a real job.

If you’re the type of person who wants to make a sustainable, lucrative career out of music, hear this.

> You **can** make money with music.

Now, more than ever, there is such a need for fresh, new music, and people are willing to pay for it. A career in music today doesn’t look like it used to ten or twenty years ago, and that’s a good thing.

Growing up in the 90's, I got this image of a full-time musician that records, tours, gets free gear from the best companies, and never has a shortage of high-paying work. As a drummer, my heroes were/are Jim Keltner and Steve Jordan. I just imagined they went from city to city, studio to studio, playing only the best music with only the best musicians all the time, and got payed a lot for it.

> Must be nice.

There was no clear path into that career. There’s still no clear path into that career. That’s why people say "being a musician is not a viable career choice."

### Here’s where content marketing comes into play.

Generating valuable content on a consistent basis grows an audience and a following that will stick with you. The outcome has a direct correlation to the energy and effort you put into it.

What this means is that **you have control** over how you grow your music career. You don’t have to wait to get signed by a record label or picked up by a band. You get to decide where the lid is on your career.

Having an audience gives you a platform to sell your music, get students, sell tickets, get hired for sessions, or meet whatever goals you have for your music and career.

> **Are you pumped up yet?**

Good!

## Now let’s grow your audience.

### Starting with Instagram.

Instagram is not the best platform for selling things or making direct revenue, but it is a fantastic platform to get people to **see** you doing what you do best.

I hear a lot of people mention the Instagram algorithm, and how it hides a bunch of posts, and delays me seeing what people had for dinner last night until lunch time tomorrow, and all sorts of tragedies.

Do you know what’s at the core of the algorithm?

> User engagement.

It's not much of a secret these days, but don’t miss the implications of what it means.

Having a large following doesn’t automatically make you an _influencer_. You have to _engage_ your following.

Have you ever been scrolling through your feed, and all the sudden someone you forgot you even followed popped up at the top of your feed, and they’re pregnant or engaged to be married, or just got married, or graduated college, or had some major life event? They just appeared at the top of your feed because they went from _not_ posting content that gets likes and comments to posting something that gets _lots_ of likes and comments.

You can use some creativity here to try and make a post that will get lots of likes and comments, but you could also look through your feed and see which posts of yours in the last year had the most likes, comments, and engagement. _History repeats itself right?_ You’ve already done things that get likes and comments.

> **Do more of that.**

\*_Not the getting married thing tho. Only do that once if you can help it._

### Do people still blog?

Yes, and you should too.

There’s this thing they don’t teach you about in music school called _search engine optimization_. Mostly because it has nothing to do with music.

[Search Engine Optimization](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo) is a discipline of creating content that is:

1. Easy for humans to read.
2. Easy for computers to read.
3. Has relevant content that humans are _searching_ for on the web.

Blogs are the perfect platform for content that is optimized for search engines. It may be hard to see how creating your musical masterpiece could have anything to do with blogging, but blogging is still the best way to reach _whitespace_.

**Whitespace** is the marketing term used to describe people who find your content that have no previous relationship with you, and do not know who you are (ie. strangers on the web).

> Your friends are cool, but do they give you money?

An example of how a blog could benefit a songwriter or a band could be reviewing newly released music. Talk about the genre, talk about the recording quality, talk about the lyrics, **just talk about it**. Do it every Friday when new music comes out. Stay up till midnight (East Coast time), pick an album, and immediately blog about it.

What I predict will happen is when people see a new album, they might search reviews for it, and guess whose review will show up? Do that consistently over time, and you’ll gain a lot of credibility with search engines which means more and more people will find your blog organically.

And just like that, you’ve created a platform to sell your own music.

## Grow your audience by teaching what you know.

Are you writing songs, recording, playing shows? How are you growing your skills, stretching your creativity, or maturing your taste in music?

Whatever it is you’re doing, you should teach others how to do it too. Teaching is an amazing tool for content marketing.

Are you an instrumentalist? Share a pro tip or show how you learned a challenging section of a song. Are you a songwriter? Share your inspiration for a song you wrote and highlight a section of the song that surprised you when you wrote it. Are you a music producer? Give away all of your secrets for the perfect vocal track.

**_HINT:_** Most of the examples I just listed are great candidates for Youtube videos. Make a short video, and **write out some video notes** that link to other resources. Having **written** content on your Youtube videos makes them more search-friendly.

## You have an audience, now what?

There are plenty of ways to generate income after growing an audience. Some are pretty obvious, and others are more subtle. **None of these will make you rich overnight**, but the combination of a few of them might just make you a decent living to help support your dream.

### 1. Spread the word about your album / EP / merch.

Tell your audience about your music and merchandise, and tell them how they can buy it or stream it.

> That's obvious right?

Here’s what’s not obvious. You need a **ton** of people to stream to your music on a streaming service before you’ll get enough money to buy a stamp so you can mail your mom a letter telling her how people are nice in Los Angeles, and your music is taking off.

> Just because you made a tastemaker’s playlist doesn’t mean you made a sustainable career.

Fortunately, streaming services are not the only way to get your music heard. What if I told you that **you** have the power to publish your own music?

There is an online service that is designed specifically for creatives and musicians to sell digital products online, and it's called **[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)** (I know, random name that tells you nothing about what it is).

There is nothing stopping you from selling your own music directly to fans in a way that gives you about a 95% profit margin. Gumroad takes 5% for processing each transaction, which, in my opinion, is totally worth it because it takes a lot more technical work than you realize to securely upload a file or folder in a way that blocks people from accessing it until they purchase it. Gumroad does all of that for you, and compared to the profit margins from one stream by one fan on a streaming service, it’s a no-brainer.

If I were going to release an album (and maybe I will sometime), I would not only get it on every streaming platform I could, but I’d also come up with a bonus package that includes stems, samples, loops, instrument tracks, album artwork and liner notes, and just about anything else I could think of bundling with it, and sell it for significantly higher than the cost of the album itself. By doing so, I’d be increasing the value of my product, and increasing the potential to make money from my hard work and creativity.

### 2. Let people know you’re available for sessions or to teach.

Once you’ve built an audience with a content marketing strategy, you’re able to drop a subtile hint or a blaring advertisement for your work.

I follow a lot of drummers on Instagram, and I’m consistently inspired by a drummer named [Dan Bailey](https://www.instagram.com/drichardbailey/). He’s played with some artists you’ve heard of and some you haven’t. He has a decently sized following, and he's always busy.

Occasionally, when he returns home from a tour, he’ll make a simple post that says he’s back and available for session work.

> It’s so crazy, it just might work.

Maybe I’ll reach out to him and ask how that works for him, but I’ve seen him do it at least twice, which tells me the first time worked out enough for him to do it a second time.

> Just tell people you’re available for hire.

People who know you may know when you’re available and when you’re not, but your growing audience may not. **You need to tell them.** Tell them you’re taking on new students. Tell them you have an open window for a quick tour. Tell them you’re free for tracking.

> **Location is not a barrier**

In any of these examples, being remote is not an obstacle. I know music teachers who teach over Skype or FaceTime, and I know plenty of musicians who record tracks on their own using files that someone sent them over the Internet.

### 3. Write a book about what you know and sell it to your audience.

When you have valuable knowledge that can make people money, people will pay you for it. Ebooks are growing in popularity, and, when self-published, have an incredible profit margin.

A great resource on writing and self-publishing ebooks is [_Authority_ by Nathan Barry](https://nathanbarry.com/authority/)

What’s great about this book is it gives practical step-by-step instructions for building an audience, writing meaningful content, publishing your work, and maximizing your sales. I _highly_ recommend this book.

### 4. Promote products through an affiliate program.

This is not the best, or even my favorite, but it’s worth mentioning because people do it.

There are Ecommerce platforms, such as Amazon, that will give you a cut of a sale if a customer clicks a link from your site to purchase something. Amazon calls it their [affiliate program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/). I’m just calling out that it exists. Look it up and see if it’s something you’re into.

If your audience is big enough, and you have an opportunity to make a little money by mentioning a product you like, then you could definitely give it a try.

## Build the music career you want

This strategy will not work overnight, but it is a proven plan for growing an online audience.

> The key to unlocking success with an online marketing strategy is **consistency**.

You _will_ see results over time if you put a plan together and follow through.
