Producers are prevalent in just about every creative or content production industry, be it Film, TV, even Podcast. For each of these media, producers have similar roles. Generally, a producer will oversee the production, handle the budget, and get the right people in the right roles.

However for music production, a producer has a more direct impact on the _creative_ direction of the music. [Danger Mouse](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Mouse_(musician)>) (of Gnarls Barkley fame) wisely compared the role of a music producer to a film director. A film director will work with a cinematographer to make sure each shot is framed perfectly, coach actors to pull an amazing performance out of them, or tweak the script to create the perfect emotional arch. Similarly, the modern music producer may direct the recording engineer to slam the compressor on the room mic to get a smashed drum sound, or make sure a vocalist can hear plenty of herself with lots of reverb in her headphones to make sure she has confidence to belt a high note, or possibly cowrite music with an artist.

### How much money can they make?

Here’s where it starts getting interesting. A producer is entitled to mechanical and sync royalties as a songwriter. To learn more about these royalties, check out this article about [making money as an independent songwriter](####).

Now, there’s a lot of nuance to getting paid as a producer. Some producers, and songwriters for that matter, will opt to get paid _on the back end_, meaning, only taking royalties when a song starts to make money. If this is the route you go, you need to be wise and realistic about what you’re worth and the potential you think a song or album has to earn money.

Producers who are just starting out in their music careers will likely need to get paid on the back end for at least a few gigs. This is normal, but also helpful to build a portfolio. Just don’t quit your day job because you landed a gig that pays on the back end. Even projects with promising artists can get shelved, run out of money, or (as I’ve seen plenty of times in LA) the artist might land a TV show because their main thing is actually _acting_.

> Just when you think you can trust someone, turns out they were an actor all along.

Some producers have a day rate, much like a hired musician would. This is in addition to any royalties generated after the project is released. Charging a day rate is a great idea for two main reasons:

1. It ensures that you, the producer, get paid. While getting paid royalties is a great source of passive residual income, it’s never guaranteed. Charging a day rate protects you from getting nothing if the project doesn’t take off or meet sales expectations.

2. It requires whoever is funding the project to put some skin in the game. Projects tend to go smoother and have a clear finish line when it’s not just for funsies and friendship.

Again much like a songwriter, the earning potential for a music producer comes down to quantity **and** quality. The best way to earn a higher income as a producer is to work often and charge a day rate.

### What makes this career enjoyable?

I have a friend who’s a successful producer, and he’s told me point blank that he loves telling people what to do. He didn’t mean it in a bossy way or have some kind of ill intent when he said it. He just genuinely likes the creative control. There’s a lot to be said of someone who can gracefully tell a guitarist who just put their heart and soul into a solo that it wasn’t the right vibe for the song.

That’s not me. I’m a 9 on the enneagram, and if you don’t know what that means, I’m the type of person who loves keeping the peace and hates rocking the boat. Confrontation of just about any kind makes me cringe, and I avoid it like the plague.

What makes being a music producer fulfilling for me is exploring new sounds and playing recording gear like an instrument. I love getting lost in creating sounds and samples that inspire me to write a song around them. I also love tweaking and refining creative processes. Finding a flow that facilitates a higher output of musical content excites me.

### How can I start doing this?

If you’ve never produced a recording, the best place to start is to write music and record it. Some of history’s best producers are accomplished songwriters as well (Jeff Lynne and Jon Brion are two of my favorites).

As I mentioned before, producers starting out in their music careers will need to build a portfolio to showcase their work to potential clients. If you already have the skills, the ears, and the musical taste to produce, start networking and meeting artists who want to record music. You might not find clients willing to pay your full day rate immediately, but keep working on your own projects, and keep pursuing paid work.
