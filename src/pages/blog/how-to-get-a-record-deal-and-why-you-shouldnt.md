When I was a teenager, I was in in a grunge/punk/church band. Our identity was a work in progress, obviously. We couldn’t land on a creative direction, but we all had hopes of getting signed by a record label. Our lead singer would say "once I get a Taylor guitar, we’ll get signed."

> We had no idea how the record industry worked.

Flash forward past the days of dial-up AOL, Myspace top 8, illegal Napster downloads, the emergence of the iTunes music store, and here we are in the age of digitally consumable music that you can take with you anywhere.

The days of making substantial money from selling physical copies of music are over, and record labels have had to adjust their strategies accordingly.

**That’s why your strategy for getting signed by a label has to change too.**

Here’s a plan that will help you get noticed by a label, and some practical steps you can take to advance your music career. Let’s start with _why_...

## Why try to get a record deal in the first place?

Most musicians I grew up with associate getting a record deal with _free money_ to support a rock and roll lifestyle. There’s this mentality that getting signed by a label means _I have the freedom to just create, and I don’t have to worry about money anymore_.

This could not be further from the truth. Any money handed over by a record label comes with **strings attached**, and there is far less money being handed out by record labels these days.

I’m not trying to say labels are evil or wrong because of this. What I _am_ saying is that we need an accurate understanding of what a record label is and does, so that we can have proper expectations of what we can get out of a record deal.

In the state of the music industry today, the three most useful benefits a record label can offer are **an advance**, **marketing resources**, and **a broad reach**.

Let’s break this down:

### Advance

An advance is a part of a [record contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_contract), and is money given directly to a recording artist for a record that has not yet been made. This money is **almost always owed back to the label** (much like a loan), and **artists will not receive royalties** until the label has recuperated their advance from record sales.

### Marketing Resources

Record labels often have a marketing team that specializes in finding or creating new ways to get the word out about their artists' music. They pour massive dollar amounts into campaigns that will get the word out to the right people who will purchase music from the label.

### Broad Reach

Because of their marketing resources, labels often have a very broad reach, meaning they have access to a large audience. They also have ways of getting their artists' music in the right channels for growth, such as film/tv, radio, and other media that also has a broad reach.

With an understanding that these are the main benefits to getting a record deal, I want to show you how you can lure the attention of a label, and at the same time eliminate your need (and hopefully _desire_) for getting a record deal.

I firmly believe that musicians today do not _need_ record labels to achieve financial success with music. Musicians should take control of their own music careers, and if they are approached by a label, be very sure that it’s mutually beneficial before signing anything.

> The only time I advocate for signing a record deal is if it is truly good for the _artist_.

That being said, below is a set of instructions that will not only help you get the attention of a record label, but will also set you up for a long-lasting, successful music carer.

## 1. Record your own album and self-publish it

You might be thinking, "wait, I thought the point was to have a record label pay for me to record an album."

> Nope.

First of all, if you wait for a record deal before you start recording an album, you’re doing a disservice to yourself and your fans. When a label pays for an album, it’s on their timeline, has to meet their standards, and may never even see the light of day. Not to mention, they’ll own a percentage, if not all, of your masters, meaning _they_ decide when and how your music is released.

Do you want that to happen to your music? **Of course not!** But there is a better way.

Do you have any idea how much the average album costs to make? Me either, and it doesn't matter.

> **Trick fact:** A record can be made on any budget!

Here are some common costs that go into making an album:

- Paying musicians for their time
- Paying a producer for their time
- Paying a recording engineer for their time
- Paying for studio time
- Paying a mix/mastering engineer for their time
- Paying a designer for album art
- Paying to have physical products produced (if you go that route)

All of this can be summed up in money being spent on **people, places, and time.** If you can reduce the amount of people you pay, the cost of the space you record in, and operate as quickly and efficiently as possible, the cost of your record will go down dramatically. If you have a space of your own to record in, have gear of your own, know how to operate it, and can play several instruments, you really only need to figure out how to distribute the final product when it’s finished.

> What I’m saying is, it’s completely possible, and even a great idea, to write, produce, perform, record, and distribute your own music.

### The recording/production phase

I’ve been a part of several recordings in my career where, when all was said and done, I could have made a better-sounding recording for a fraction of the cost if I had chosen to purchase my own recording gear and self-record instead of booking time at a "professional" recording studio.

That’s the reality we live in today, and it’s a beautiful thing. Professional and semi-professional recording gear is getting better _and_ more affordable at the same time.

99% of the time, I would advise artists, bands, and producers to buy their own recording gear instead of sinking money into buying time at a recording studio. Yes, there’s a time and place to record at a nice studio, but for early-stage artists and bands, now is not the time.

You can make _professional sounding_ recordings with a [Shure SM58](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/SM58--shure-sm58-cardioid-dynamic-vocal-microphone), an [Apogee Duet](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Duet2iOS--apogee-duet), and [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/). You can get all of these for under \$1,000. You might be thinking, "but I want big drum sounds on my recordings." Well, I’ve recorded some killer sounding drums with an SM58 going through an Apogee Duet in Logic Pro. I set the mic up about 10-12 feet away from the kit on a vocal mic stand, and pointed it at the kick drum.

> Boom!

It requires a different mindset when you play and record this way. You have to self-mix while you’re playing, and you have to actually _tune_ the drums to sound good in the room. But doing so makes you a better musician anyway, so why not?

Logic Pro will make up for any recording limitations you may feel from only having a single mic. Its plugins and virtual instruments rival any expensive bundles out there. And the more you record yourself, the more you’ll learn to get the sounds you want out of your gear.

### The post-production phase

Let’s say you took my advice and purchased recording gear instead of paying money to rent time at a studio, and you started to record your own music, and you’re happy with the sounds you’re getting.

> Now what?

Next, you’ll need to mix and master your recordings. If you don’t know what that means, google it. The art of mixing and mastering is nuanced and subtle, and I highly recommend that any producer/engineer learns how to do it.

If the thought of it sounds daunting, or you’re not happy with your results, this is the part where you may actually want to hire a mixing/mastering engineer to get your recordings across the finish line.

After you’ve got masters of your recordings, you’re nearly on your way to making some money from them. At this point, you can and should put them on any paid streaming service out there. But do not expect to make a fortune unless you have a massive following that will stream your music. I mentioned in a previous post about [how independent songwriters can make money](/blog/how-to-make-money-as-an-independent-songwriter/) that streaming services typically pay between $0.004 and $0.01 per stream. Just do a little math, and you’ll find that you need millions of streams just to make a decent wage.

Another sales channel you have available to you is the Internet, and you should utilize it to its full potential.

A great strategy for selling your music is to think bigger and wider than just the finished masters that you upload to streaming services. Think of how you can package your music into digital bundles that you can sell for much more than what a CD used to cost.

> CD's are those shiny discs that hipster dive bars use as coasters.

Thinking bigger and wider about your music not only proves to a record label that you understand how to make _products_ from your _craft_, but it also sets you up to have more personal success with your music.

**Here’s what I would do as an example.**

I’m going to record an album. I’m going to write, perform, produce, engineer, mix, and master it all by myself. I have recording gear of my own, so this will cost me \$0 and as much time as I’m willing and able to put into it.

I’m going to set up a phone to record and document my process on video. I’m going to make a library of all of the drum sounds I capture, so other producers can use them as samples. I’m going to make loops out of drum parts, guitar parts, bass parts, anything that sounds interesting. I’m going to make instrumental tracks by removing the vocals. I’m going to mix down stem files so my music can easily be set to film/TV. I’m going to make digital album artwork complete with liner notes and lyrics. I’m going to keep my thinking cap on during the process to see if there’s anything else I can add to a bundle.

> And I’ll sell it for a high price.

What you see here is a list of ingredients that you can mix and match into different recipes, meaning you can make different bundle combinations with them and sell them at different prices. Maybe the album itself along with the liner notes and a short documentary would go for $15-$20. Throw in loops and samples, and price it at $35. Add the stems and instrumental tracks, and price it at $50.

I haven’t put a ton of thought into this pricing model, but here’s what I’ve learned from my time as a software engineer building digital products:

> You can make a lot more money by selling fewer items that are priced high than if you priced low and sold a lot.

Let’s look at some of the numbers. Maybe you work really hard on growing your following on social media, and you’re up to 10,000 followers. You post about your music, and half of your followers give your music a listen — let’s say a 10-song album, so that’s 5,000 people listening to 10 songs, which is 50,000 streams on a streaming service at \$0.0075/stream.

> \$375

Ok, let's keep going, and I’ll use some realistic online marketing numbers. Let’s take that same 10,000 followers and market a $50 bundle to them. Statistically, if 1% of your following converts, you’re doing great — that’s 100 people buying a $50 bundle.

> \$5,000

If that makes sense, and you’d like to try self-publishing your own music and digital products, spin up a simple website with Wordpress and hook it up to [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) for your digital product hosting and payment processing.

By doing this, you’ll demonstrate to a record label that you can take ownership of your own sales and marketing channels, and get results.

## 2. Focus on growing your audience instead of writing a hit song

One thing you need to know about record labels in the 21st century is that **they do not like taking risks**.

> It is your job to prove that you are an asset, not a liability.

The best way to do this is to demonstrate that you can grow a substantial fan following and turn your fans into customers. Some artists may not like this concept of having _customers_, but you need to call them what they are. Without _customers_, you will have no livelihood. The difference is, if they are truly fans, they will be happy to be your customer, and if you continue to provide something meaningful to them, they will be _repeat customers_.

> If you give your fans what they want, they’ll give you what you need.

Not to say you shouldn’t write hit songs, but if you hide away for a long time and emerge from the shadows with a hit song, **no one will care**.

> **You must have an audience for your music to take off.**

### Harness the power of content marketing to grow your audience

Record labels are great at getting the word out about the latest album by their artists, and rightfully so. This is how labels make the majority of their money. Like I mentioned earlier, record labels have teams of marketing experts devising new ways to make people aware of their new products. They have large budgets set aside to buy billboard ads, digital ads, social media marketing, and any other channel that converts people into customers.

**But what about the unsigned artist?**

I’ve got great news for you. You have the ability start a marketing campaign on your own, and do it on a "starving artist" budget.

> You have the ability to turn your creativity into marketing content.

I recently wrote an article on [how to grow your audience with content marketing](/blog/how-musicians-can-grow-their-audience-with-content-marketing/), so check it out to go deeper. But here are the basics:

#### 1. Teach what you know

Educational content doubles as great marketing content. It makes your content _discoverable_, and it establishes you as an expert on a topic. So write about how you landed a gig that you worked really hard to get, or blog about your process for recording a song you wrote. Anything you _write_ on the internet can be easily searched and discovered, **so write a lot**.

#### 2. Establish a posting schedule for social media and stick to it

Social media algorithms favor consistency and engagement, **so post often, and make your posts _engaging_**. Avoid overloading your feed with lifestyle shots of you looking cool playing music, at least at first. People engage with posts that provide value, so find a way to incorporate educational content into your social media posts. Using appropriate hashtags and tagging other accounts can make your posts more discoverable, but it’s meaningful content that will entice and engage people once they find you.

#### 3. Use your platform to sell your products or services

Once you’ve grown an audience by teaching what you know and sticking to a consistent posting schedule, _tell_ your audience how they can stream your music or buy your products.

As you post and generate content, more and more people can discover what you have to offer. When the time is right, post about something you made that you’re selling.

> Sell it shamelessly.

Make sure people know that it’s available and that you want them to buy it. If you subtly suggest that there’s a product out there that people should buy, it does’t give the authority and urgency that it could have if you tell people you poured your heart and soul into something, and it’s the best you have to offer, and they need to buy it.

Using educational content to build an audience and selling your products and services to them is essential to getting any credibility with a record label. Even if this process isn’t the catalyst to get you in front of label executives, it will most certainly be your leverage in negotiations. When you take control of your music career and start making money with your creativity, it reduces your need to sign with a label because you’re already profitable without them.

## Why you’re better off without a record label

So far I’ve talked about recording your own music, publishing and distributing your own music, and growing your audience with content marketing. If you’ve done any of this or feel like this is attainable and realistic for you, **you clearly don’t need a record label to back you financially.**

### Redefine success for your music career

You do not need to sign to a record label to be a successful musician. If getting signed by a label is your only criteria for success in a music career, you have already failed. Your goal should be to use your creativity and craft to make the most money possible for as long as possible. That's the goal of everyone in any other career field, so make it yours too.

I'm a software engineer now, and I would never settle for staying in the same position for too long. I need to move up and get promotions to continue to provide for my growing family, and also to get what I deserve from learning and growing my skills.

> Working long-term in a craft sharpens your skills for that craft. You should get paid like you’re good at what you do.

The tricky part is that music is fun, and musicians have a tendency to count the enjoyment of the job as payment for the job. I’ve heard several noteworthy musicians talk about how a gig needs to have two of three things: good songs, good people, and good pay. I don’t disagree with that way of thinking as long as one of those two things is always good pay (and if the pay is great, maybe compromise in the songs and people categories). If I had this mentality when I was a full-time musician, I would have gotten a lot further in my career. Now that I’m a software engineer, it is understood that my time is worth money.

> Musicians need to act like their time is worth money too.

### Keep your money. Don’t give it to a record label

Assuming you have the marketing power you need to get the word out about your music (and you do), you really shouldn’t be giving a label leverage over your creativity and income.

Let’s imagine that your end-goal is to sign a recording contract with a label. You should be recording your own music as a way of sharpening your skills and honing your craft, and you should be self-publishing it as a way of generating income. You should also be growing your audience with content marketing and selling your products to them. That’s the recipe for making steady, long-term income on your creativity. It’s also that way to get noticed by a record label. If you’re already doing it, and you’re happy making a living from your craft, **don’t complicate things or take the joy out of it by signing with a label**.

If a deal comes along that happens to be mutually beneficial, and you’ve done research and ran the contract by a trusted lawyer, then by all means, go for it. But for the vast majority of musicians, going the unsigned route can be equally lucrative without sacrificing any creative control.

## Who’s doing this well?

A few artists come to mind who are applying this principle to their music careers.

### Twin Shadow

One of my favorite artists is [Twin Shadow](https://www.instagram.com/thetwinshadow/). I remember anticipating his album _Caer_. Before it came out, he mentioned that he wrote it and recorded it, and _then_ he landed a deal with Warner Music. When he signed with the label, they were happy with the recordings. I can imagine that when he was recording his music, he may not have had any intentions of signing with a major label. He already had a fan base, and he already had a streak of solid albums. The label could see that he was on a path for growth and signed him. It was not risky at all for Warner since they could already see the results from his previous albums.

The rest of the story is that **he dropped the label** after the release of _Caer_, and his next album will be released under his own indie label. In my opinion, this is the ultimate mark of success for an artist — positioning your career in such a way that you **do not need a label**. More artists should look at Twin Shadow’s career for inspiration.

**Also**, I'm an advocate for musicians finding innovative ways to monetize their creativity, and Twin strikes again. He packaged and sold a bundle of samples and synth patches that he used on the album.

> Your album is not the only product you can sell.

### Davie

I mentioned in a previous blog that my first paying gig after I moved to Los Angeles was with an artists called [Davie](https://www.instagram.com/musicbydavie/). In addition to being a great musician and songwriter, he knows how to grow an audience and produce meaningful content.

His latest release [_Girls Raised in the South_](https://l.instagram.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fartist%2F3LtkIxt8EHLpuXMOpFYZ06%3Fsi%3Dp0hBWVx2SwmbLi3NPcgcHg&e=ATNv16WdprNey38_WjvWFv_0UcCwLYF7Ml7mO33oHFogPhRyWrWuXnnHvRBCSX5mZ7h1b3YS) was independently recorded and distributed, and he’s been able to land a few sync deals with his music, meaning, **he doesn’t have to share any royalties with a label**.

### Meija

[Meija](https://www.instagram.com/jamiesierota/) is a songwriter/producer that has been steadily growing his audience and releasing music. Writing and producing his own music has opened doors for him to produce and co-write with other bands and artists as well.

His latest EP [_So Long Kid_](https://lnk.to/solongkid) is innovative and authentic, and was independently recorded and distributed as well.

## What’s stopping you?

**If these musicians can do it, you can too!** Make your own music on your terms, grow your audience, and turn them into customers.
