I was able to attend a very insightful clinic on incorporating electronics into your drum kit.  The event was hosted by [Jon Matteson](https://instagram.com/jonmatteson) and [Christian Paschall](https://instagram.com/christianpaschall). They each talked about the tools they use and their approach to hybrid drumming. 

One thing I especially appreciated about the event was that these two drummers tend to operate at different ends of the hybrid drumming spectrum.  Jon, being a pop drummer, leans heavily on his electronics, while Christian, being a country/pop drummer, is on the lighter side of hybrid drumming. However, there is a lot of crossover within their respective toolsets.

Here are my three takeaways from the evening.

## 1. Hybrid drumming has become essential for career growth

If you want to be a busy drummer, specifically in Nashville, **incorporating electronics into your setup/skillset is a MUST**. 

## 2. Show up to rehearsals prepared

You don't have time to tinker with settings and software while you're on the rehearsal clock. You won't be getting asked back if you aren't prepared ahead of time.

## 3. Have a backup plan on stage

The two talked a lot about having a redundant setup. This means that if their computer crashes or software quits unexpectedly, they have an identical setup ready to go.  This tends to be pricy when it comes to having two computers, but if you have to think of a way to keep the show going if something goes wrong.

## Final thoughts

I've been into hybrid drumming for a while, and if you're intimidated by the price tag that comes along with it, my advice is to start small. I've played massive venues running on a MacBook Pro with Ableton Live, MIDI triggers, audio interfaces and the whole nine yards.  I've also triggered sounds from my phone using [Reason's Figure app](https://www.reasonstudios.com/mobile-apps) coming out of the built-in headphone jack. Get experimental, and find small ways to incorporate something digital into your all acoustic setup.
