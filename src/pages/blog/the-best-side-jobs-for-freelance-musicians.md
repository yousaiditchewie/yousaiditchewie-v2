Before I dig in, I want to make a distinction that these are *side hustle* jobs, not necessarily full-time careers. If you want to explore ways musicians can make money on a full-time career level, check out my article on [music careers that make the most money](https://www.jacobondrums.com/blog/music-careers-that-make-the-most-money/).

This list will start off with some of the low-hanging fruit, and ramp up to, in my opinion,

>THE GREATEST SIDE HUSTLE OF ALL TIME!!!

## 3. Online ride share and delivery services

This includes apps like [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/), [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/), and [Postmates](https://postmates.com/). Basically, the idea is to monetize your car. 

I’ve done plenty of driving for ride shares, and it can actually be fun and entertaining. I will warn you that the clientele for Lyft was much more friendly and approachable than for Uber.  Ironically, Lyft costs were typically higher than the cost of an Uber ride a few years back when I was doing it, and somehow the customers paying *less* money for their ride were *more* entitled, and the customers paying more were much friendlier. That’s just an observation on the affects pricing can have on your product. Just a thought...

>What if you’re undercharging for your skills as a musician?

### Pros:
* **Flexible** — Got a gig coming up? Don’t go online!
* **Low commitment** — Don’t feel like it? No biggie!
* **Get payed fast** — Get your money in about about a week.


### Cons:
* **Not amazing pay** — It’s ok, but maybe not enough to keep you afloat.
* **Wear and tear** — Your car’s value will drop like a rock.
* **No benefits** — No sick pay, no payed time off, no insurance.

## 2. Starbucks

Yep, good old [Starbucks Coffee](https://www.starbucks.com/careers/). I've had a few friends/roommates who have worked at Starbucks, and there are a **lot** of perks to working there part time.

### Pros:
* **Decent hourly wage** — Definitely enough to keep you on your feet if you’re wise with your money.
* **Free coffee and discounts** — If you’re a coffee addict, like most musicians I know, this will save you money.
* **Part-time benefits** — Healthcare, sick time, stock options, all for part-timers.

### Cons:
* **Clopening** — Closing down shop at 11:30pm, taking a quick nap, then opening up at 4am.
* **Retail hours** — You’ll need to find shift swaps and request time off for those unexpected gigs that pop up.

>Drumroll for the best side gig ever...

## 1. Apple Retail

Ok here's the gift that keeps on giving. When I moved to Los Angeles to grow my music career, I was blessed enough to land a job at [Apple Retail](https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/retail.html), and I worked there for just about 4 years until I landed a full-time retainer gig as a drummer.

I started off as a part-time sales representative, called a "Specialist" at the time, and worked my way up the ladder to be a full-time "Genius" when I left. I reaped a lot of benefits from the company that set me up for success long-term. I can confidently say that 4 years at Apple is the equivalent of a business degree if you're willing to learn and grow as a professional.

I'll list the pros and cons for working at Apple, but before I go there, here are a few *lessons learned* from working at Apple that last longer than your tenure there.

### Clear communication is a learned skill.

When your job is to talk to people all day, every day, you realize that you tell people the same things over and over. But what's interesting is that the same words may not resonate with one customer the way they do for another customer. The *message* is the same, but it takes different *words* for different people. This lesson has stuck with me to this day, and is why I've developed a reputation as an engineer who can communicate technical concepts in a way that non-tech people understand **without making them feel dumb** — that's the key.

>Clear communication means no one feels talked down to.

### Patience and empathy are worth their weight in gold.

Imagine trying to coach an elderly person in making a FaceTime call with their grandkids. Can you put yourself in their shoes enough to not get frustrated with they click the wrong buttons or don't know how to unmute the speakers?

This level of patience and empathy is a prerequisite for [growing your audience](/blog/how-musicians-can-grow-their-audience-with-content-marketing/) or [teaching students](/blog/how-to-make-money-as-a-music-teacher/) how to play an instrument. 

### Document your wins.

By the time I left Apple, I had getting a promotion down to a science. In 4 years, I had 3 promotions — 1 every year, with some overlap. I was first promoted from a part-time sales position to a part-time tech support position. Then, I was able to level up from part-time to full-time tech support.  After that, I went from small device tech support to a fully certified Mac Technician (my certifications are still active, so I can still say I'm a "Genius").

A key lesson came when I missed my first promotion. I asked why I didn't get it, and my leader told me that I didn't have enough real-world scenarios to speak of when asked behavioral questions. He told me I need to **document my wins**, so that during my next interview, I could speak more specifically as to why I'm the right fit for the role.

As it turned out, I actually did get that promotion after he went to bat for me, but I took that lesson to heart and never missed another promotion. 

### Pros:

* **Great part-time pay** — As far as I'm aware, Apple retail pays among the highest hourly wages for part-time employees.
* **Great part-time benefits** — Sick pay for part-timers, stock options, commuter benefits, the list goes on and on.
* **Apple discounts** — This one has likely changed a lot since I've left, but I will say, I was able to get the newest phone every year, and break even by selling my 1-year-old phone on eBay.  Plus I got a 2015 Macbook Pro for half the price, after all their discounts.
* **Free software** — Apple gives their Pro software to their employees for **free**, including Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro.
* **Third-party discounts** — This is the big one for musicians. Companies like [Apogee Electronics](https://apogeedigital.com/) and [Blue Microphones](https://www.bluedesigns.com/) offer better discounts on their products to Apple employees than Apple offers for their own products. Land a job at Apple for a year or two, and you could easily outfit a legitimate studio on a shoestring budget.

Keep in mind, all of these perks are subject to change, and I've been out of the company for nearly 6 years now.

### Cons:

* **Retail hours** — Want to play a show? You're probably scheduled to work, and you'll have to swap your shift.
* **Customers can be BRUTAL** — Seriously. I left one shift in tears.

If you can think long-term about working a side hustle like Apple, you can get to the other side set up for success financially, and learn a lot of great lessons along the way.
