Teachers have an important and often overlooked role in the music industry. Educators not only teach the mechanics and theory behind making music, but they also teach musical taste (yes, musical taste can be taught), mentor and offer guidance, and inspire musicians towards excellence and craft.

> Story time

I don’t remember specifically _when_ I felt the urge to play the drums, but it was pretty early on. It was mandatory for me and my siblings to take two years of piano lessons, so from ages eight to ten, I begrudgingly took piano lessons — **not drum lessons**. I kept asking my parents for drum lessons, but my dad was a guitar player, so he tried to get me hooked on guitar instead. That didn't stick. Finally, my dad let me take a few drum lessons to see how I would do before making the commitment to buy a drum set.

I was twelve when I first picked up a pair of drumsticks with the intent of hitting drums to make music.

**Plenty of kids pick up drumsticks to make _noise_, but I wanted to make _music_.**

My first drum teacher, Ron, was hands down my most influential musical teacher. I’ll never forget my first drum lesson. My dad was the music director at a church, and Ron was my dad’s music associate which meant I could have a quick drum lesson in the choir room before choir practice. The drums were right next to the piano, and Ron knew I played piano too. He asked me what kind of music I like to listen to and a specific song that I like.

My dad was a fan of anything from the 70's, but especially the band _Chicago_. So naturally, I loved _Chicago_ too. I really liked the song _Saturday in the Park_.

Ron started playing it on the piano, and my eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. He was playing in the key of _C Major_ which is the easiest key on the piano. He showed me how to play it on piano, then he jumped on the drums and joined in. I was a terrible sight-reader in my piano lessons, but when I could see and hear how a song was played, I could play it easy. I had never played _piano_ like that before, and it sounded so cool when I was making music with someone else, especially a _drummer_.

Then we stopped, and Ron did a simple exercise with me. He had me play basic rhythmic patterns on the hi-hat, snare, and bass drum, one hand and foot at a time, then he slowly had me add another limb until I was playing an actual drum beat. When he saw that I was keeping the beat, he jumped back on the piano, and our roles were reversed. I was playing drums to a song I loved.

**I was making _music_ on the drums.**

There’s no way to adequately put into words the feeling I felt in that moment. It sparked something inside me that has never left me to this day. If it weren’t for educators and music teachers, no one would get to have music careers because no one would be so inspired to play that they can’t imagine life without being able to play.

> That’s what educators do.

### How much money can they make?

The short answer is _it depends_. But like any other field, there are actions you can take to gain control over the trajectory of your career.

There are at least two main highways that lead to making a music career in education. The first is teaching at a school or an existing institution — **working for someone else**. The second is teaching lessons either privately, online, or in some other way — **working for yourself**.

Depending on what level you teach in the first category, you may be able to take a decent salary with benefits, especially if you are able to teach at the collegiate level. However, I would like to argue that you could make _more money_ and/or get _more fulfillment_ from the self-employed model.

Ten years ago, you had to be in close proximity to your students, which limited your potential customers to those around you.

> But we live in the age of the internet.

You are no longer limited to teaching people in your neighborhood or in your city or even on your continent. You are no longer need to find a venue to host group lessons.

**You only need a device with video chat capabilities!**

I know several educators who specialize in web-based education. They hold private lessons over Skype or FaceTime, and it works great for them. You get to have a flexible schedule, you get to choose your pricing, you get to conduct your own marketing campaigns to grow your client list. **You are in control of your career.**

And one-on-one lessons are only the beginning. More and more musicians are offering lessons and courses in a lecture format on platforms like [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/).

### What makes this career enjoyable?

It may sound cliche, but **people love making a difference in the world**. Being a music teacher is so much more than just teaching notes on a scale.

Not only do you get to inspire and encourage people, but there are so many life skills and career skills baked into learning an instrument. As a career changer from music to software engineering, music has helped me incredibly along my journey. Music taught me that it’s OK to sound bad because that means you’re doing something that you’re not good at, which means you’re learning and growing. As a software engineer, I’m constantly dealing with technologies I know nothing about and have to figure them out as I go, and that’s OK because I’m learning and growing. Music taught me how to collaborate effectively. As a software engineer, I’m constantly working with new people who have different strengths than me, and I get to let my strengths shine while backing off in areas where someone else is stronger. Learning an instrument and studying music sharpens your ability to recognize patterns. As a software engineer, a large portion of my time is spent identifying and repeating patterns.

> When you teach music, you not only give the intrinsic blessing of music itself, but you’re also equipping students with tools for life.

If that doesn’t get you excited to teach, I don’t know what will!

### How can I start doing this?

The first step is assessing your instrument, your available space, your network, and your schedule. If you have a job already, teaching should fit into your life — you shouldn’t start off by rearranging your life to work around teaching. That may be necessary eventually if you grow a large list of students or if your online courses start taking off, but initially, your work should come first.

If you’re a drummer, you’ll need space to have a drum set set up, either where you live, at an office, or even at a student’s house. Most of my drum lessons in my early years of playing took place at my house on my drums in my basement. If you play just about any other instrument, the ability for you to teach remotely over the web increases substantially. It’s possible to teach drums over the web, but you’ll still need a space to set them up and make some noise, and so will the student on the other end. The key with remote teaching is **you have to _see_ your student playing** to make technique suggestions and corrections, and they need to _see_ you as well.

Another form of educating that is essential to a sustainable music career is _content marketing_.

> Content marketing?

Yeah.

You need to be blogging, releasing tutorial videos on Youtube or Instagram (or both), and releasing helpful tips on Twitter. The trick here is turning your students’ questions or struggles into educational content that you can publish on the web. This might be easier once you have a few students, but a lack of students is no excuse for not doing this.

The fact is **educational content is incredibly effective for marketing**. By teaching everything you know online (yes, don’t keep any secrets), **you position yourself as the expert**. This is the secret to increasing your rates and gaining more students at the same time. Routinely releasing educational content boosts your credibility for search engines and makes your content a higher priority on social media platforms.
