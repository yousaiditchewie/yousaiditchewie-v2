  With the spread of Coronavirus, many musicians are without work. Shows and tours have been cancelled, and even churches have stopped gathering for the foreseeable future. I want to give musicians hope and ideas for how they can overcome financial hurdles in these difficult times.

What a crazy time to be alive. Who would have thought a virus that broke out on the other side of the globe would have such disruptive effects all over the world.

Musicians are taking a huge financial hit right now. With tours and shows being cancelled, many musicians are without work. I saw an Instagram post from a musician who was the drummer for a tour that got cancelled, and even the coffee shop where he works while he's in town is closing indefinitely.

> He lost two jobs at once.

Imagine the stress he’s going through right now. He’s not the only one. I know a lot of musicians who make steady income playing at churches, and even _they’re_ closing their doors for Sunday gatherings.

I could go on and on with **bad** news, but I’m actually here to cheer you up and give you a dose of **hope**, because you need it.

Musicians can be in a lot of different places in their financial journey. Income is always fluctuating, so there’s seasons of drought and seasons of plenty.

I’m going to focus on people who can identify with three different statements:

1. I'm not going to make it through the month, and I’m freaking out.
2. I'll be fine for a month or two, but something will have to change beyond that.
3. I have enough to survive the next 3-6 months, but I want to make sure I have enough after that.

## I’m not going to make it through the month

I hate to break it to you, but you’ll need to think outside of the field of music for immediate help. You’ve got to take care of yourself and your family, if you have one, and you’re not going to find what you need with music right now. I want you to stay active as a musician, but making money is your priority now.

### Dave Ramsey's 4 walls

If you’re truly in crisis, I like what Dave Ramsey has to say. He’s a personal finance guru and has helped millions of people get out of a tight spot. He says, in times of crisis, take care of the <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/4-things-you-must-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four walls</a>of your household, which are **food, utilities, shelter, and transportation**.

If you have these four things, you can live to fight another day.

That takes care of how to prioritize the money you _have_. Let’s talk about ways to _make_ money without having to leave your house.

### User Testing

As a software engineer, I’ve been exposed to the world of user testing. User testing is a process that involves observing someone use your software or digital product to learn their behavioral interactions. Sometimes this means going to a place where people are to find a volunteer to use your product, but in the age of the internet (and now social distancing), we no longer need to be in-person to watch someone use what we’ve built. There’s a service called <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/be-a-user-tester" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usertesting.com</a> that pays people to test software and digital products. In a similar way that Uber connects drivers to passengers, usertesting.com connects product owners to users. Their pitch is that they pay \$10 for every 20 minutes of testing you complete. All you need is the internet, a relatively modern computer, or a smartphone.

### Upwork

Another way to get some cash flowing while you’re at home is to set up an account with <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwork.com</a>. They have plenty of freelance roles for technologists (engineers and testers), but they also have plenty of job openings for audio production, and even more generic roles like customer support.

### Glassdoor

If you’re looking for full-time work, and if you’re in crisis mode you should be, take a look at Glassdoor’s article on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/companies-eager-to-hire-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">companies hiring in light of COVID-19</a>. They list several tech jobs, but lots of other jobs too. Also, Amazon announced they’re hiring 100,000 roles in the next year for shipping and logistics facilities, which includes locations in Nashville and Austin, two major music cities.

### One book to read and one podcast to binge if this sounds like you:

While you’re inside, staying away from people, and stressing over not having enough money, you should check out Dave Ramsey's #1 best seller, <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/store/product/the-total-money-makeover-book-by-dave-ramsey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_The Total Money Makeover_</a>. If you’re so broke you can afford a book, try checking it out on a library app like <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overdrive</a> or <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoopla</a> (these require a library card).

And another resource that’s always 100% free is <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_The Dave Ramsey Show Podcast_</a>. You can learn everything he teaches in the book from the podcast, only the book is more direct and very practical. The podcast is a great introduction to his personal finance principles and is a great way to get pumped up about getting your money under control.
