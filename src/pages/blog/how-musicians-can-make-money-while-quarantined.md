  With the spread of Coronavirus, many musicians are without work. Shows and tours have been cancelled, and even churches have stopped gathering for the foreseeable future. I want to give musicians hope and ideas for how they can overcome financial hurdles in these difficult times.

What a crazy time to be alive. Who would have thought a virus that broke out on the other side of the globe would have such disruptive effects all over the world.

Musicians are taking a huge financial hit right now. With tours and shows being cancelled, many musicians are without work. I saw an Instagram post from a musician who was the drummer for a tour that got cancelled, and even the coffee shop where he works while he's in town is closing indefinitely.

> He lost two jobs at once.

Imagine the stress he’s going through right now. He’s not the only one. I know a lot of musicians who make steady income playing at churches, and even _they’re_ closing their doors for Sunday gatherings.

I could go on and on with **bad** news, but I’m actually here to cheer you up and give you a dose of **hope**, because you need it.

Musicians can be in a lot of different places in their financial journey. Income is always fluctuating, so there’s seasons of drought and seasons of plenty.

I’m going to focus on people who can identify with three different statements:

1. I'm not going to make it through the month, and I’m freaking out.
2. I'll be fine for a month or two, but something will have to change beyond that.
3. I have enough to survive the next 3-6 months, but I want to make sure I have enough after that.

## I’m not going to make it through the month

I hate to break it to you, but you’ll need to think outside of the field of music for immediate help. You’ve got to take care of yourself and your family, if you have one, and you’re not going to find what you need with music right now.
