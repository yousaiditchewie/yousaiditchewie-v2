  With the spread of Coronavirus, many musicians are without work. Shows and tours have been cancelled, and even churches have stopped gathering for the foreseeable future. I want to give musicians hope and ideas for how they can overcome financial hurdles in these difficult times.

What a crazy time to be alive. Who would have thought a virus that broke out on the other side of the globe would have such disruptive effects all over the world.

Musicians are taking a huge financial hit right now. With tours and shows being cancelled, many musicians are without work. I saw an Instagram post from a musician who was the drummer for a tour that got cancelled, and even the coffee shop where he works while he's in town is closing indefinitely.

> He lost two jobs at once.

Imagine the stress he’s going through right now. He’s not the only one. I know a lot of musicians who make steady income playing at churches, and even _they’re_ closing their doors for Sunday gatherings.

I could go on and on with **bad** news, but I’m actually here to cheer you up and give you a dose of **hope**, because you need it.

Musicians can be in a lot of different places in their financial journey. Income is always fluctuating, so there’s seasons of drought and seasons of plenty.

I’m going to focus on people who can identify with three different statements:

1. I'm not going to make it through the month, and I’m freaking out.
2. I'll be fine for a month or two, but something will have to change beyond that.
3. I have enough to survive the next 3-6 months, but I want to make sure I have enough after that.

## I’m not going to make it through the month

I hate to break it to you, but you’ll need to think outside of the field of music for immediate help. You’ve got to take care of yourself and your family, if you have one, and you’re not going to find what you need with music right now. I want you to stay active as a musician, but making money is your priority now.

### Dave Ramsey's 4 walls

If you’re truly in crisis, I like what Dave Ramsey has to say. He’s a personal finance guru and has helped millions of people get out of a tight spot. He says, in times of crisis, take care of the <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/4-things-you-must-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four walls</a> of your household, which are **food, utilities, shelter, and transportation**.

If you have these four things, you can live to fight another day.

That takes care of how to prioritize the money you _have_. Let’s talk about ways to _make_ money without having to leave your house.

### User Testing

As a software engineer, I’ve been exposed to the world of user testing. User testing is a process that involves observing someone use your software or digital product to learn their behavioral interactions. Sometimes this means going to a place where people are to find a volunteer to use your product, but in the age of the internet (and now social distancing), we no longer need to be in-person to watch someone use what we’ve built. There’s a service called <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/be-a-user-tester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usertesting.com</a> that pays people to test software and digital products. In a similar way that Uber connects drivers to passengers, usertesting.com connects product owners to users. Their pitch is that they pay \$10 for every 20 minutes of testing you complete. All you need is the internet, a relatively modern computer, or a smartphone.

### Upwork

Another way to get some cash flowing while you’re at home is to set up an account with <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upwork.com</a>. They have plenty of freelance roles for technologists (engineers and testers), but they also have plenty of job openings for audio production, and even more generic roles like customer support.

### Glassdoor

If you’re looking for full-time work, and if you’re in crisis mode you should be, take a look at Glassdoor’s article on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/companies-eager-to-hire-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">companies hiring in light of COVID-19</a>. They list several tech jobs, but lots of other jobs too. Also, Amazon announced they’re hiring 100,000 roles in the next year for shipping and logistics facilities, which includes locations in Nashville and Austin, two major music cities.

### One book to read and one podcast to binge if this sounds like you:

While you’re inside, staying away from people, and stressing over not having enough money, you should check out Dave Ramsey's #1 best seller, <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/store/product/the-total-money-makeover-book-by-dave-ramsey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">_The Total Money Makeover_</a>. If you’re so broke you can afford a book, try checking it out on a library app like <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overdrive</a> or <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoopla</a> (these require a library card).

Another resource that’s always 100% free is <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">_The Dave Ramsey Show Podcast_</a>. You can learn everything he teaches in the book from the podcast, only the book is more direct and very practical. The podcast is a great introduction to his personal finance principles and is a great way to get pumped up about getting your money under control.

## I'll be fine for a month or two, but something will have to change beyond that

There’s a lot of money to be made online while working anywhere, specifically, your home while people are sheltering in place. Here’s a few ideas that may take a few weeks or months to ramp up, but you can little-by-little earn some decent money doing these.

### Teach from home

I know several people who are teaching voice and instrument lessons from home. Even my own mother is doing this while she’s not going into work. If you already have students, that’s a plus. Just have them meet over Skype or FaceTime instead of in-person. If you don’t currently have students, start putting feelers out there on social media or by using your network to find out if anyone knows anyone in need of lessons.

For more ideas, check out my article on [how to make money as a music teacher](/blog/how-to-make-money-as-a-music-teacher/).

### Remote sessions

More and more musicians are doing remote sessions on their free time, and now that tours and shows have been cancelled or postponed, it’s pretty much a necessity. This is an easy decision and transition if you already have your own space and recording gear, but don’t be intimidated if you don’t have gear already. Recording gear is becoming better and more affordable at the same time. If you are starting from scratch, you’ll most likely need a recording interface, studio monitors, and whatever mics and cables are necessary for your instrument. Check out <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/manufacturer/Focusrite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweetwater’s Focusrite bundles</a> for a place to start. In my opinion, anything in Focusrite’s Scarlet series will do the job.

### Loop and sample libraries

If you already own recording gear or decide to buy a pack like I mentioned above, there's no reason not to sell loop and sample libraries. Just spend some time recording yourself practicing, rehearsing songs, or just goofing off, and chances are, you’ll be making something someone else could use for their recordings or writing session.

As for selling them, you’ll need a website and an ecommerce platform. I’m a huge fan of Shopify, and regularly build ecommerce sites for clients with it. I have an advantage in that I can build my own website from scratch, so I use a combination of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GatsbyJS</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify CMS </a>, and <a href="https://gumroad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gumroad</a> for selling things on my site. I built by site, hosted it, and can sell products, all for FREE because I know how to code (more on that topic in a few paragraphs).

### Online licensing

In short, online licensing is uploading your music to an online marketplace where content creators (primarily videographers) can discover music and pay to use it in their videos. There is still a lot of video production that hasn’t been shut down in light of COVID-19. Online licensing may not decline as quickly as other ways of generating revenue with music. But act fast on this one just to be safe.

I give a much more detailed explanation of the mechanics of online licensing in my article, [how to sell your music independently](/blog/how-to-sell-your-music-independently/).

### One book to read and one podcast to binge if this sounds like you:

If you identify with this category, and feel inspired to standup a home studio and start making money with it, here’s two powerful resources.

First of all, read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mixing-Your-Mind-Closely-Engineering/dp/0646428756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">_Mixing With Your Mind_</a>. If you can handle a \$175 purchase on a book right now, it’s a fundamental read for anyone trying to make money capturing sound and turning it into _music_.

I get it, the price tag is steep, and times are uncertain, so here’s another resource that’s free — <a href="https://www.thesixfigurehomestudio.com/podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">_The Six-Figure Studio Podcast_</a>. This free podcast shares a lot of practical knowledge from two experienced home studio owners who not only figured out how to make money with their studios, but are great at sharing their methods to success.

### I’ll make it 3 to 6 months, but I want to make sure I can thrive after that

The last group if people I’ll address are those who maybe have some money saved up for a rainy day, but know it won’t last indefinitely. If that sounds like you, I want to encourage you to get creative with your career and set yourself up for success when this whole things blows over (and it will eventually).

When the economy rebounds, and music venues re-open their doors, I want you to have an _advantage_ and take control of your career. The way to do that is to start building your online audience. This takes time and dedication, but if you have some extra time on your hands while you’re not going out, it can pay off. Content marketing is the way to grow your audience with the end goal of turning those fans into repeat customers.

### Content marketing

Content marketing is a method of publishing _valuable_ content on the internet in a way that allows people to _discover_ your product(s) or brand, so that people who are searching the internet will find _you_. This typically consists of educational information or thought-leadership materials. But the idea is simple:

> Billions are searching the web. Be the one&nbsp;they&nbsp;find.

Again, I wrote an article on [how musicians can grow their audience with content marketing](/blog/how-musicians-can-grow-their-audience-with-content-marketing/) that lays out a clear path, but here’s some nuggets of wisdom from it.

While you have some free time, start a blog, a Youtube Channel, or a podcast. Make educational videos on anything you know how to do, whether it’s a tasty lick you just learned on guitar, or how to get that vocal sound you’ve been chasing for a while and finally found, or how to incorporate electronic drums into your acoustic setup.

> **Educational** content makes excellent **marketing**&nbsp;content.

### Write an ebook

Here’s one that’s out-of-the-box for sure: **write an ebook**.

If you’ve built an audience with educational content, and have fans who enjoy your teaching style, write a book on your highest-performing topics. If you can write 500-1,000 words every day for the next month or two, you will easily have a 35,000 word ebook that you could sell. There are several influencers and thought leaders who have made great money selling their thoughts in writing. **You can do it too**.

### Learn to code, and become a digital entrepreneur

Let’s go even more out-of-the-box. **Learn to code and build an online business**.

Learning to code takes time and experience, but I learned how to do it in 12 weeks. I went to a full-time, immersive coding boot camp and learned all the fundamentals of coding enough to get a job as a software engineer. Looking back, however, I realized I could have easily learned everything I needed to online, and my coding education would have been far less expensive than it was.

There are plenty of coursed on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Treehouse</a> if you want to buy a course or two, but there are also some great coding resources that are completely free, like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Code Camp</a>.

The internet is still a wide-open frontier where ideas can become businesses with very little overhead cost, but it is still essential to grow a following, so that when you launch an online business, people **are aware** and ready to purchase.

### One book to read and podcast to binge if this sounds like you:

If you got bit by the entrepreneur bug and that idea excites you, take a look at these resources.

Read the book <a href="https://nathanbarry.com/authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">_Authority_ by Nathan Berry</a>. The book acts as a step-by-step guide to writing and self-publishing an ebook. It goes into great detail about how to grow an audience to sell your ebook to as well.

As far as internet entrepreneurship goes, you can’t beat <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">_The Indie Hackers Podcast_</a>. Yeah, you may need to learn to code before some of it is applicable, but more and more, digital entrepreneurs are opting for **no-code** solutions using WordPress, Wix, and Shopify.

## Don’t lose hope, and dream **BIG**!

Stay strong, and don’t let social distancing keep you from pressing into **community**. You need other people and other people need you! These hard times will pass, and we’ll make it to the other side. When we get there, have big goals and big dreams for your career. Take these steps to set your career up to take off like a rocket when things get back to normal.
