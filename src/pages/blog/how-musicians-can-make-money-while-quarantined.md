Intro
What a crazy time to be alive.

Introduce 3 categories:

- I'm not going to make it through the month, and I’m freaking out
- I'll be fine for a month or two, but something will have to change beyond that
- I have enough to survive the next 3-6 months, but I want to make sure I have enough after that

## I’m not going to make it through the month

Intro Dave's 4 walls and baby steps. Link to articles for each.
