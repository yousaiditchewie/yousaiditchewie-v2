If you have any aspirations to be a professional or career musician and you’ve had the guts to tell people what you want to do, you’ve probably been faced with a lot of negative feedback. I’ve had my fair share. People would tell me "you can’t make money as a musician," or "you need to get a real job," or the classic "the music industry doesn’t work the way it used to."

If you’ve been met with criticism and objections like these, just know that the people telling you this love you and want what’s best for you, but they have no idea how to make money as a musician. And who can blame them? There’s not a degree you can get or a certification you can complete that qualifies you to be a working musician. The path is not mapped out, and the people who are doing it well are not always sharing their keys to success. If they are, they can often be summed up by being in the right place at the right time.

**The truth is, there has never been a better time to be a musician.**

The music industry _has_ changed, but the change has been for the better. With the rise of digital media and the internet, the music industry has become decentralized in a way that empowers the individual to make their own living. This means _you_ have the power to take controll of your music career and make good money doing it.

Before getting into the mechanics of making money as a musician, I want to set expectations for what a music career might _look_ like.

## What does a musician do?

**If your instrument of choice is the drum set, then plan on doing a lot of manual labor.**

No joke. During my time as a touring drummer, I would spend roughly an hour or more unloading my drums from the tour bus, carrying them around the building because there isn’t bus parking at the stage entrance, setting up my hardware, setting up my drums, tuning them, setting up all of my electronics (computer, midi interface, audio interface, computer stand, etc.), setting up mic stands, put mics on them, running cables to the snake...

> Waiting...

Sound checking...

> Waiting...

Play 15-30 minutes of music...

> Waiting some more...

Maybe have a drink.

> Maybe have another...

**Ok, time to tear down.** Another hour-plus wrapping up mic cables, putting mics away, putting my electronics in their cases, packing up the drums, putting away hardware, carrying the drums across the street because the bus had to move...

> Oh crap, it’s raining.

Loading up the bus, get on it, dry off, question why I became a drummer in the first place, fall asleep, wake up in another city...

> Waiting...

Do it all over again.

That’s just if your _gig du jour_ is on the road.

There are plenty of opportunities for musicians to make money. Touring is one of them, although you have to be a special type of person to really enjoy it (which I am not). Musicians can make money playing recording sessions, playing at churches, weddings, bars, really anywhere there’s a need for live music.

Living in Los Angeles, I found an interesting niche market for musicians who would play for film and TV. A lot of the people you see playing music in the background of movies and on TV shows are actual musicians that were hired as background actors.

> Who would have though?

Needless to say, get creative because the need for musicians is everywhere.

## How much money can musicians make?

The pay for being a musician depends on who’s paying the bills and the need for the musicians. What I mean is, a wedding band may have a set cost that they charge, and a wedding party can either pay that fee or choose another band, putting the power in the hands of the band. However, in other cases, there are shows or productions that have a set operating budget, and if a musician is chosen to perform in it, they will have to accept the pay that is given, even if it is lower than what the musician’s standard day rate, putting the power in the hands of the production.

Most musicians I know charge a day rate or a half-day rate for smaller gigs. That’s only if the pricing power is in their control.

I talk about where the pricing power lies because it is such a pain point for musicians. I struggled with this in my own music career. I always had a desire to make more money, but there always seemed to be something blocking me from making more. It’s a juggling act trying to make sure you don’t sell yourself short, but also you want to be attractive with your pricing, but if you aren’t staying busy enough, you’ll need to get another job or make money some other way which seems to make you less attractive to the market.

It sucks.

> But there is a better way.

Instead of waiting to get picked, you can take control of the pricing power. I wrote an article about [how to use content marketing to grow their career](###). I strongly believe that musicians can get control of their music careers and enjoy their time doing it.

## What makes being a musician enjoyable?

Come on, playing music for money? It’s like getting paid to play with puppies. Who wouldn’t want that?

Music truly does enrich people’s lives, both for the people making the music and the people listening. It is simultaneously high art and street entertainment. There’s just something special about it, and people who can make a decent living doing it feel like they never work a day in their lives.

Unless you’re a touring drummer. Just learn to play the guitar or sing. Trust me.

## How can I start making money as a musician?

To be a "professional" musician, you really only need to _get paid_ to make music. I can call myself a plumber all I want, but I’ll never be a "professional plumber" until I get paid for it. The difference is, it’s much easier to fake the part of a musician than a plumber (at least in my opinion).

Here’s what I mean. If you want to set out to attain a long-lasting music career, you probably already have the skills needed to get started. Just to have the _interest_ in a music career means you most likely have some natural talent or have had some kind of affirmation that you’re skilled.

> That’s the best place to start.

### Get some constructive feedback

Test yourself to see if you have the skills before making decisions that will affect your future. If you know someone whose main source of income is music, talk to them. Find out how they got started, and ask them what you need to learn or do to make that happen for yourself. Listen to them and see if they think you could do what they do, or if they try to talk you out of it. You’ll need to establish trust with this person and/or apply some social awareness to the situation. People do not like disappointing people if they can avoid it. Be on the lookout for a _yes_, when the truth is _no_.

After testing to see if a music career is right for you, **start building an audience**.

### Start building an online audience

**Building an audience is essential to launching a music career of any kind**. Social media is new enough that we might associate people like [John Mayer](https://www.johnmayer.com/) with having an online audience _because_ he’s a famous musician, and that would be a fair assumption. But there are people, like [Tyler Ward](https://www.youtube.com/user/TylerWardMusic), who can become successful musicians by first growing an online following.

Growing an audience from nothing takes a lot of time and dedication, but anyone can do it. I wrote an article on [how musicians can grow their audience using content marketing](###) to help musicians grow their following and learn how to make money with their creativity.
