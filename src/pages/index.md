## Long story short

I was a touring and session drummer for a season, and now I write code for a living. The thing about being a musician is there's no clear path to doing it for money in such a way that's steady and sustainable. Most people will attribute success to being in the right place at the right time or knowing the right people.

I went through a draught as a musician and had to turn to other passions and skills to provide for my family. That's when I learned how to write code. I started doing web development for tech startups and marketing agencies and learned a **ton** about how the internet works and how to grow an online audience.

I'm dedicating my website to unraveling the mysteries of the internet, so that musicians can grow their online audience and turn them into paying customers and life-long fans.
