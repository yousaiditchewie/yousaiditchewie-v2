## About Me

Ever since I was 15, I dreamed of being a full-time musician. I moved to Los Angeles after college to pursue that dream and was lucky enough to acheive it. The dream turned out not to be as glorious as I had hoped it would be, so I learned how to code and became a software engineer.

Along the way, I learned the power of internet marketing and have gained powerful tools to help creatives grow a loyal fanbase and gain the financial support to sustain their dreams.
